### 3. GraphQL API Design Protocol
- **Schema Design**: When designing GraphQL APIs, you MUST:
  - Create clear, well-structured type definitions.
  - Design appropriate object types for entities.
  - Implement proper relationships between types.
  - Use input types for mutations consistently.
  - Design interfaces and unions for polymorphic types.
  - Implement pagination with connections when appropriate.
  - Document types with descriptions.

- **Query Design**: You MUST:
  - Design query fields with appropriate arguments.
  - Implement field-level permissions and visibility.
  - Design efficient nested queries.
  - Implement proper filtering and sorting capabilities.
  - Consider query complexity and depth limitations.
  - Design pagination for collection fields.
  - Document query capabilities and examples.

- **Mutation Design**: You MUST:
  - Create consistent mutation naming conventions.
  - Design input types with appropriate validation.
  - Implement proper error handling for mutations.
  - Return appropriate data after mutations.
  - Consider optimistic UI updates in mutation responses.
  - Design idempotent mutations when possible.
  - Document mutation behavior and side effects.

- **Subscription Design**: When implementing subscriptions, you MUST:
  - Identify appropriate events for subscriptions.
  - Design subscription payloads with relevant data.
  - Implement proper filtering for subscriptions.
  - Consider performance and scalability implications.
  - Design authentication and authorization for subscriptions.
  - Document subscription behavior and examples.
  - Consider server-side throttling and limitations.
