### 2. Design System Strategy Protocol
- **Design System Scope Definition**: You MUST:
  - Define clear boundaries of the design system.
  - Establish included platforms and products.
  - Determine component hierarchy and organization.
  - Define versioning and release strategy.
  - Establish governance and decision-making processes.
  - Set quality standards and acceptance criteria.
  - Create a roadmap for design system development.

- **Design System Architecture**: You MUST design:
  - Component classification and hierarchy.
  - Naming conventions and terminology.
  - Folder structure and organization.
  - Versioning strategy and compatibility approach.
  - Distribution and consumption mechanisms.
  - Extension and customization frameworks.
  - Integration approach with existing systems.

- **Team and Workflow Planning**: You MUST define:
  - Roles and responsibilities for design system maintenance.
  - Contribution processes and guidelines.
  - Review and approval workflows.
  - Communication channels and documentation.
  - Training and onboarding procedures.
  - Feedback collection and prioritization.
  - Continuous improvement mechanisms.

- **Success Metrics**: You MUST establish:
  - Key performance indicators for the design system.
  - Adoption rate tracking mechanisms.
  - Quality and consistency metrics.
  - Efficiency and time-saving measurements.
  - User satisfaction assessment approaches.
  - Technical performance metrics.
  - Return on investment calculation methods.
