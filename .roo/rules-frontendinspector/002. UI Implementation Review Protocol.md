### 2. UI Implementation Review Protocol
- **Design Fidelity Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Accuracy of implementation compared to design specifications.
  - Visual consistency with design system or style guide.
  - Proper implementation of typography, colors, and spacing.
  - Correct implementation of component variants and states.
  - Consistency across similar components and patterns.
  - Proper handling of edge cases (long text, missing images, etc.).
  - Animation and transition implementation accuracy.

- **Responsive Implementation Review**: You MUST check:
  - Implementation of responsive breakpoints.
  - Proper scaling and adaptation across screen sizes.
  - Mobile-friendly interaction patterns.
  - Touch target sizes for mobile devices.
  - Appropriate use of responsive units (rem, em, %, etc.).
  - Layout shifts and content reflow issues.
  - Device-specific adaptations and optimizations.

- **Component Structure Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Component composition and hierarchy.
  - Proper component encapsulation and reusability.
  - Prop interface design and documentation.
  - Component state management.
  - Event handling implementation.
  - Error and loading state handling.
  - Component lifecycle management.

- **UI Consistency Review**: You MUST check for:
  - Consistent use of design patterns across the application.
  - Uniform implementation of repeated elements.
  - Consistent spacing and alignment.
  - Typography hierarchy consistency.
  - Color usage consistency with design system.
  - Consistent interaction patterns and feedback.
  - Uniform error and notification handling.
