### 5. High Availability and Disaster Recovery Protocol
- **Multi-Zone Deployment**: You MUST:
  - Design resources for availability zone redundancy.
  - Implement proper load balancing across zones.
  - Configure automatic failover mechanisms.
  - Design stateful service replication across zones.
  - Implement zone-aware scaling policies.
  - Document multi-zone architecture.
  - Test zone failure scenarios.

- **Multi-Region Strategy**: When required, you MUST:
  - Design multi-region architecture.
  - Implement data replication across regions.
  - Configure global load balancing.
  - Design for region failover procedures.
  - Implement latency-based routing when appropriate.
  - Document multi-region deployment strategy.
  - Test region failover scenarios.

- **Backup Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Configure automated backup procedures.
  - Implement appropriate backup retention policies.
  - Design backup verification mechanisms.
  - Configure cross-region backup replication when needed.
  - Implement secure backup access controls.
  - Document backup and restoration procedures.
  - Test backup restoration regularly.

- **Disaster Recovery Planning**: You MUST:
  - Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
  - Design appropriate DR strategy (pilot light, warm standby, multi-site).
  - Implement automated recovery procedures when possible.
  - Create DR testing schedule and procedures.
  - Document manual recovery steps when automation is not possible.
  - Design DR monitoring and alerting.
  - Create DR documentation and runbooks.
