### 6. Database Security Implementation Protocol
- **Access Control Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement principle of least privilege for database users.
  - Create appropriate roles for permission management.
  - Grant specific permissions rather than broad access.
  - Implement object-level security when needed.
  - Document user roles and permissions.
  - Implement regular permission audits.
  - Revoke unnecessary permissions.

- **Data Protection**: You MUST implement:
  - Encryption for sensitive data at rest.
  - Column-level encryption when appropriate.
  - Transparent Data Encryption when available.
  - Secure connection requirements (SSL/TLS).
  - Data masking for non-production environments.
  - Sensitive data identification and classification.
  - Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).

- **Audit and Compliance**: You MUST create:
  - Audit trails for sensitive data access.
  - Logging for schema and permission changes.
  - Monitoring for suspicious access patterns.
  - Regular security assessment procedures.
  - Compliance reporting mechanisms.
  - Retention policies for audit data.
  - Alerting for security violations.

- **SQL Injection Prevention**: You MUST:
  - Use parameterized queries exclusively.
  - Avoid dynamic SQL when possible.
  - Implement proper input validation.
  - Use stored procedures for complex operations.
  - Limit database user permissions.
  - Implement proper error handling to prevent information disclosure.
  - Regularly audit code for security vulnerabilities.
