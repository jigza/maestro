### 5. MCP Tool Usage Protocol
- **Web Search Integration**: When using `answer_query_websearch`, you MUST:
  - Formulate precise, specific questions targeting the information needed.
  - Focus queries on current versions, best practices, and compatibility.
  - Verify information across multiple sources when possible.
  - Prioritize official documentation and reputable sources.
  - Document the specific queries used for transparency.

- **Documentation Exploration**: When using `explain_topic_with_docs` or `get_doc_snippets`, you MUST:
  - Target specific technical topics requiring detailed explanation.
  - Focus on implementation patterns and best practices.
  - Request concrete code examples for key concepts.
  - Verify the information is for the correct version of the technology.
  - Synthesize information from multiple related queries when necessary.

- **Best Practices Compilation**: When using `generate_project_guidelines`, you MUST:
  - Specify the exact technology stack with versions.
  - Request comprehensive guidelines covering all aspects of development.
  - Focus on project-specific considerations and constraints.
  - Ensure guidelines address security, performance, and maintainability.
  - Adapt the guidelines to the specific project context.

- **Result Verification**: For all MCP tool results, you MUST:
  - Critically evaluate the information for relevance and accuracy.
  - Cross-reference critical information across multiple queries.
  - Identify any contradictions or ambiguities requiring clarification.
  - Note any limitations or caveats in the information provided.
  - Clearly distinguish between factual information and recommendations.
