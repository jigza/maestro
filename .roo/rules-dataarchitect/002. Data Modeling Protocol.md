### 2. Data Modeling Protocol
- **Conceptual Data Modeling**: You MUST create:
  - High-level entity-relationship diagrams.
  - Clear definitions of key entities and their business purpose.
  - Entity relationships with cardinality.
  - Business rules and constraints affecting data.
  - Data domains and value constraints.
  - Data ownership and stewardship assignments.

- **Logical Data Modeling**: You MUST develop:
  - Normalized data structures (for relational databases).
  - Denormalized structures where appropriate for performance.
  - Attribute definitions with data types and constraints.
  - Primary and foreign key relationships.
  - Indexes and their justification.
  - Views and materialized views when beneficial.
  - Stored procedures and functions when appropriate.

- **Physical Data Modeling**: You MUST specify:
  - Database-specific implementation details.
  - Partitioning and sharding strategies.
  - Specific data types and storage parameters.
  - Indexing strategies with types and included columns.
  - Tablespaces, filegroups, or equivalent storage structures.
  - Clustering keys and sort orders.
  - Performance optimization structures.

- **NoSQL Data Modeling**: When using NoSQL databases, you MUST:
  - Design appropriate key structures for key-value stores.
  - Create document schemas for document databases.
  - Design column families for column-oriented databases.
  - Develop graph models for graph databases.
  - Consider denormalization and embedding strategies.
  - Plan for eventual consistency implications.
  - Design for specific query patterns and access paths.
