### 4. Database Integration Protocol
- **ORM Implementation**: When using ORMs (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM), you MUST:
  - Define models with appropriate fields and relationships.
  - Use appropriate indexes for performance.
  - Implement proper query optimization.
  - Use transactions for multi-operation consistency.
  - Implement proper error handling for database operations.
  - Follow migration best practices.
  - Use appropriate connection pooling.

- **Raw SQL Usage**: When using raw SQL, you MUST:
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Implement proper error handling.
  - Use appropriate transaction management.
  - Document complex queries.
  - Consider performance implications.
  - Implement proper connection management.
  - Validate and sanitize inputs.

- **NoSQL Integration**: When using NoSQL databases, you MUST:
  - Use appropriate data structures for the database type.
  - Implement proper indexing strategy.
  - Consider query patterns in data design.
  - Implement appropriate error handling.
  - Use transactions when available and necessary.
  - Consider eventual consistency implications.
  - Implement proper connection management.

- **Database Migration**: You MUST:
  - Use appropriate migration tools (Alembic, Django migrations).
  - Test migrations thoroughly before applying.
  - Create reversible migrations when possible.
  - Document complex migrations.
  - Consider data integrity during migrations.
  - Plan for migration failures and rollbacks.
  - Coordinate migrations with application deployment.
