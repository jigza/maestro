### 5. Authentication and Authorization Protocol
- **Authentication Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement secure password handling with proper hashing.
  - Use JWT or sessions securely.
  - Implement proper token validation and verification.
  - Create secure login and logout flows.
  - Implement multi-factor authentication when required.
  - Handle authentication errors securely.
  - Implement proper session management if applicable.

- **Authorization Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement role-based or attribute-based access control.
  - Create middleware for authorization checks.
  - Implement resource-level permissions.
  - Document permission requirements for endpoints.
  - Implement proper error responses for unauthorized access.
  - Create audit logging for sensitive operations.
  - Test authorization rules thoroughly.

- **OAuth Integration**: When implementing OAuth, you MUST:
  - Configure OAuth providers correctly.
  - Implement secure token handling and storage.
  - Create proper callback handling.
  - Implement profile mapping and normalization.
  - Handle authentication errors gracefully.
  - Implement token refresh mechanisms.
  - Document OAuth flow and configuration.

- **Security Best Practices**: You MUST implement:
  - HTTPS enforcement in production.
  - Secure HTTP headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.).
  - Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.).
  - Rate limiting and brute force protection.
  - Input validation and sanitization.
  - Secure cookie configuration.
  - Security logging and monitoring.
