### 3. Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Query Optimization**: You MUST implement:
  - Efficient database queries with proper indexing.
  - Query optimization techniques (SELECT only needed fields, etc.).
  - Appropriate use of database features (views, stored procedures, etc.).
  - Caching strategies for frequent queries.
  - Batch processing for bulk operations.
  - Connection pooling and efficient resource usage.
  - Query monitoring and performance logging.

- **Application Performance**: You MUST optimize:
  - Algorithm efficiency and time complexity.
  - Memory usage and resource allocation.
  - Asynchronous processing for I/O-bound operations.
  - Concurrency and parallel processing where appropriate.
  - Background job processing for long-running tasks.
  - Response time for critical endpoints.
  - Resource cleanup and memory management.

- **Scalability Implementation**: You MUST consider:
  - Horizontal scaling capabilities.
  - Stateless design for service instances.
  - Distributed caching strategies.
  - Message queues for asynchronous processing.
  - Database sharding or partitioning strategies.
  - Load balancing considerations.
  - Service discovery and registration when applicable.

- **Caching Strategies**: You MUST implement:
  - Appropriate cache levels (in-memory, distributed, etc.).
  - Cache invalidation strategies.
  - Cache headers for HTTP responses.
  - Data-specific caching policies.
  - Cache monitoring and management.
  - Fallback mechanisms for cache failures.
  - Cache warming strategies when appropriate.
