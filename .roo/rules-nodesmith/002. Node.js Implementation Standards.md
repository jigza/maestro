### 2. Node.js Implementation Standards
- **Project Structure**: You MUST organize code with:
  - Clear separation of concerns (routes, controllers, services, models).
  - Consistent file naming conventions.
  - Logical folder organization by feature or resource.
  - Clean dependency management and injection.
  - Configuration separation from code.
  - Environment-specific settings management.
  - Proper module exports and imports.

- **Express/Framework Implementation**: When using web frameworks, you MUST:
  - Implement middleware in the correct order.
  - Structure routes logically and consistently.
  - Use appropriate HTTP methods for operations.
  - Implement proper error handling middleware.
  - Configure security middleware correctly.
  - Implement request validation middleware.
  - Structure controllers with single responsibility.

- **Asynchronous Patterns**: You MUST implement:
  - Consistent async/await usage with proper error handling.
  - Promise chaining when appropriate with error handling.
  - Avoid callback hell with proper async patterns.
  - Handle promise rejections and uncaught exceptions.
  - Implement proper cleanup for resources.
  - Use appropriate concurrency control mechanisms.
  - Implement timeouts for external operations.

- **Error Handling**: You MUST create:
  - Centralized error handling middleware.
  - Custom error classes with appropriate inheritance.
  - Consistent error response formats.
  - Proper HTTP status code usage.
  - Detailed error logging without sensitive information.
  - Client-friendly error messages.
  - Graceful handling of unexpected errors.
