### 2. CI/CD and IaC Strategy Protocol
- **Pipeline Architecture Design**: You MUST design and document the conceptual stages of the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy) and the recommended triggers and quality gates.
- **Build and Test Strategy**: You MUST specify the recommended approach for building artifacts, integrating automated tests (unit, integration), and performing security scans within the pipeline.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Strategy**: You MUST recommend an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) and define the strategy for managing infrastructure code, including state management and environment separation.
- **Secret Management Strategy**: You MUST define a secure strategy for managing secrets and credentials within the CI/CD process.
