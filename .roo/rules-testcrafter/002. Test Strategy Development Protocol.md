### 2. Test Strategy Development Protocol
- **Test Approach Selection**: You MUST:
  - Determine appropriate test types based on project needs.
  - Define the testing pyramid structure for the project.
  - Establish risk-based testing priorities.
  - Select appropriate testing techniques for different components.
  - Define shift-left testing approaches when applicable.
  - Establish continuous testing integration in the development lifecycle.
  - Define exploratory testing strategies to complement automated testing.
  - **Include strategy for identifying and testing common runtime errors** specific to the tech stack (e.g., hydration errors, unhandled promise rejections, type mismatches).

- **Test Coverage Planning**: You MUST define:
  - Code coverage targets for unit testing.
  - Functional coverage requirements for critical features.
  - Integration test coverage for component interactions.
  - UI/UX test coverage for user journeys.
  - Performance test coverage for critical paths.
  - Security test coverage for sensitive functionality.
  - Regression test coverage strategy.

- **Test Environment Strategy**: You MUST specify:
  - Test environment requirements for each test level.
  - Environment provisioning and management approach.
  - Test data management strategy.
  - Production-like environment requirements.
  - Containerization approach for test environments.
  - Cloud vs. local environment considerations.
  - Environment cleanup and reset procedures.

- **Test Tooling Recommendations**: You MUST recommend:
  - Test frameworks appropriate for the technology stack.
  - Test runners and execution tools.
  - Assertion libraries and utilities.
  - Mocking and stubbing tools.
  - Test data generation tools.
  - Test reporting and visualization tools.
  - Test management and organization tools.

- **Static Analysis Tooling Integration**: Ensure the testing strategy includes integration and execution of project-configured linters (e.g., ESLint, Flake8) and formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black) as part of the overall quality checks, potentially within CI pipelines if not run pre-commit.
