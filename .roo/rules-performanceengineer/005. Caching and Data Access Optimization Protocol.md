### 5. Caching and Data Access Optimization Protocol
- **Caching Strategy Design**: You MUST:
  - Identify appropriate caching layers (browser, CDN, application, database).
  - Recommend cache technology selection.
  - Define cache key design and namespacing.
  - Specify cache expiration and invalidation strategies.
  - Design cache hierarchy and layering.
  - Address cache consistency challenges.
  - Recommend cache size and eviction policies.

- **Application Caching Implementation**: You MUST recommend:
  - In-memory caching implementation.
  - Distributed caching architecture.
  - Cache warming strategies.
  - Cache hit ratio optimization.
  - Cache monitoring and analytics.
  - Framework-specific caching features.
  - Function/computation result caching.

- **Database Caching**: You MUST analyze and improve:
  - Query result caching.
  - Prepared statement caching.
  - Connection pooling optimization.
  - Buffer pool and memory configuration.
  - Materialized view usage and refresh strategies.
  - Database-specific caching features.
  - Read replica usage for query distribution.

- **Data Access Patterns**: You MUST identify and recommend:
  - Batch processing for multiple operations.
  - Lazy loading implementation for related data.
  - Eager loading optimization for known access patterns.
  - Data prefetching strategies.
  - Pagination and partial data retrieval.
  - Data denormalization for read optimization.
  - Read/write splitting patterns.
