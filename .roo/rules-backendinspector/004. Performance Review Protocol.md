### 4. Performance Review Protocol
- **Query Optimization Assessment**: You MUST check:
  - Efficient database query patterns.
  - Proper use of indexes.
  - N+1 query problem prevention.
  - Appropriate use of eager vs. lazy loading.
  - Efficient join and relation handling.
  - Query result caching when appropriate.
  - Pagination implementation for large datasets.

- **Resource Utilization Review**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Memory usage and potential leaks.
  - CPU-intensive operations optimization.
  - Efficient use of connection pools.
  - Proper resource cleanup and disposal.
  - Appropriate use of caching.
  - Efficient file and stream handling.
  - Thread and process management.

- **Concurrency Assessment**: You MUST check:
  - Thread safety in shared resources.
  - Proper locking and synchronization.
  - Race condition prevention.
  - Deadlock prevention.
  - Efficient asynchronous programming patterns.
  - Proper use of thread pools and worker queues.
  - Scalability considerations for concurrent operations.

- **Network Efficiency Review**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Minimization of network requests.
  - Proper use of batching and bulk operations.
  - Efficient serialization and deserialization.
  - Appropriate use of compression.
  - Connection management and reuse.
  - Timeout handling and retry strategies.
  - Efficient API design for minimal data transfer.
