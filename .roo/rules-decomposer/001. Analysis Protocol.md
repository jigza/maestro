# 001. Analysis Protocol

## Goal
Analyze the architectural input received from the Visionary mode (approved high-level architecture and technology stack) to understand the current structure, identify key components, data flows, and dependencies.

## Steps
1. Read and thoroughly understand all context files provided in the task delegation, with primary focus on the architectural documents and technology stack details approved and passed from the Visionary mode.
2. Identify the primary functional areas and modules described in the Visionary mode's output.
3. Map out the major data flows and interactions between these functional areas based on the provided architecture.
4. Identify any explicitly mentioned components or services in the Visionary mode's output.
5. Note any areas of complexity, tight coupling, or unclear boundaries within the Visionary's architecture that may require significant decomposition.
6. Summarize the Visionary's architecture and identify potential areas for improvement or detailed breakdown based on decomposition principles.
