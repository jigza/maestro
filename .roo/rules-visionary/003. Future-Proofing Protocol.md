### 3. Future-Proofing Protocol
- **Scalability Planning**: You MUST design for:
  - Horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities.
  - Load balancing and distribution strategies.
  - Database scaling and partitioning approaches.
  - Caching strategies and data access optimization.
  - Resource utilization efficiency.

- **Extensibility Design**: You MUST ensure:
  - The architecture can accommodate new features without major rework.
  - Extension points are clearly identified and documented.
  - APIs are designed for evolution and backward compatibility.
  - Configuration over code principles are applied where appropriate.
  - Pluggable components and modular design are emphasized.

- **Technology Evolution Strategy**: You MUST consider:
  - Expected lifespan of selected technologies.
  - Upgrade paths and version migration strategies.
  - Encapsulation of volatile components to minimize change impact.
  - Abstraction layers to isolate implementation details.
  - Monitoring industry trends for potential future shifts.

- **Business Continuity Planning**: You MUST address:
  - Disaster recovery approaches.
  - Data backup and restoration strategies.
  - High availability configurations.
  - Graceful degradation capabilities.
  - Business continuity during upgrades and migrations.
