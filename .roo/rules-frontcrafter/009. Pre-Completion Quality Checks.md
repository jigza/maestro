### 9. Pre-Completion Quality Checks
- **Mandatory Checks**: Before reporting task completion to Maestro, you MUST:
  - Run the project's configured linter (e.g., ESLint) using `execute_command` and fix **all** reported errors and warnings that violate project standards.
  - Run the project's configured formatter (e.g., Prettier) using `execute_command` to ensure code style consistency.
  - If applicable, run the project's build command (e.g., `npm run build`, `vite build`) using `execute_command` to check for build-time errors or type errors (if using TypeScript). Fix any errors found.
  - **Check for critical runtime errors:** After a successful build, if feasible without violating the non-blocking command rule (Rule #8), briefly check the browser console during local testing setup or initial page load for critical JavaScript errors. Address any critical errors found.
  - Ensure all implemented code adheres to the standards defined in `code-standards.md` and other relevant context files.
  - **Only report task completion once all checks pass without errors.**
