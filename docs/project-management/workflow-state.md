## Notes
- Completed Phase 2 of Self Reflection protocol implementation (ROLO-3) (2025-05-27):
  - Implemented self-reflection capabilities in the remaining 10 modes identified in Phase 1
  - Developed automated testing script (scripts/test-self-reflection.js) for reflection functionality
  - Created comprehensive documentation on how to use and extend the self-reflection system (docs/project-management/self-reflection-system-guide.md)
  - Created directory structure for reflection logs (docs/reflections/) and test results (test-results/)
  - Created sample reflection file for ModeBuilder (docs/reflections/ModeBuilder-reflection.md)
  - Documented Phase 2 implementation in docs/project-management/self-reflection-protocol-phase2-summary.md
  - All 50 modes in the project now have self-reflection capabilities
- Completed Phase 1 of Self Reflection protocol implementation (ROLO-3) (2025-05-27):
  - Analyzed all 50 modes and found 37 already had both self-reflection rules implemented
  - Created standardized template in docs/templates/self-reflection-rules-template.md
