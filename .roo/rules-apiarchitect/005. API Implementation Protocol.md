### 5. API Implementation Protocol
- **Request Handling**: You MUST design:
  - Request validation and sanitization.
  - Content negotiation and media types.
  - Request parsing and deserialization.
  - Header processing and validation.
  - Request logging and monitoring.
  - Request correlation and tracing.
  - Request timeout and cancellation handling.

- **Response Formatting**: You MUST:
  - Design consistent response structures.
  - Implement proper content type and serialization.
  - Design error response formats.
  - Implement hypermedia and HATEOAS when appropriate.
  - Design pagination metadata.
  - Implement proper HTTP caching headers.
  - Document response formats with examples.

- **Error Handling**: You MUST design:
  - Consistent error response formats.
  - Appropriate error codes and messages.
  - Detailed error information for debugging.
  - User-friendly error messages.
  - Localized error messages when applicable.
  - Error logging and monitoring.
  - Error handling for different scenarios.

- **Performance Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Design efficient data loading patterns.
  - Implement appropriate caching strategies.
  - Consider pagination for large collections.
  - Design batch operations for multiple resources.
  - Implement compression for responses.
  - Consider asynchronous processing for long-running operations.
  - Document performance considerations and recommendations.
