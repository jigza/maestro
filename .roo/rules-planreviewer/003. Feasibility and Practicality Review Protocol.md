### 3. Feasibility and Practicality Review Protocol
- **Technical Feasibility Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Compatibility with selected technologies.
  - Alignment with team skills and expertise.
  - Availability of required libraries and frameworks.
  - Feasibility of proposed algorithms and approaches.
  - Compatibility with existing systems and infrastructure.
  - Adherence to technology constraints and limitations.
  - Realistic assessment of technical challenges.

- **Implementation Complexity Evaluation**: You MUST assess:
  - Development effort and timeline feasibility.
  - Component implementation complexity.
  - Integration complexity and challenges.
  - Testing complexity and coverage.
  - Deployment and operational complexity.
  - Maintenance and support requirements.
  - Learning curve for new technologies or approaches.

- **Resource Requirement Analysis**: You MUST check:
  - Hardware and infrastructure requirements.
  - Software licenses and third-party services.
  - Development team size and skills.
  - Operations and support resources.
  - Budget alignment with proposed architecture.
  - Timeline feasibility for implementation.
  - External dependencies and constraints.

- **Operational Feasibility**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Deployability in target environments.
  - Monitoring and observability capabilities.
  - Backup and disaster recovery feasibility.
  - Scalability and performance under expected load.
  - Security operations and management.
  - Maintenance and update procedures.
  - Support and troubleshooting capabilities.
