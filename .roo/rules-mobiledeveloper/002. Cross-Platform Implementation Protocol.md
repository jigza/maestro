### 2. Cross-Platform Implementation Protocol
- **React Native Implementation**: When using React Native, you MUST:
  - Follow React Native best practices and patterns.
  - Implement proper component structure and organization.
  - Use appropriate state management solutions.
  - Implement efficient navigation patterns.
  - Handle platform-specific code appropriately.
  - Optimize performance for both iOS and Android.
  - Implement appropriate error boundaries and fallbacks.

- **Flutter Implementation**: When using Flutter, you MUST:
  - Follow Flutter best practices and patterns.
  - Implement proper widget structure and composition.
  - Use appropriate state management solutions.
  - Implement efficient navigation and routing.
  - Design responsive layouts for different screen sizes.
  - Optimize performance for both iOS and Android.
  - Implement appropriate error handling and fallbacks.

- **Cross-Platform UI Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement consistent UI across platforms while respecting platform conventions.
  - Use platform-adaptive components when appropriate.
  - Handle different screen sizes and orientations.
  - Implement proper keyboard handling and input methods.
  - Design for different device capabilities.
  - Handle platform-specific gestures and interactions.
  - Implement accessibility features across platforms.

- **Cross-Platform Code Sharing**: You MUST:
  - Design appropriate code sharing strategy.
  - Implement platform abstraction when needed.
  - Organize shared business logic effectively.
  - Design clean interfaces for platform-specific implementations.
  - Implement feature detection for different capabilities.
  - Document platform differences and considerations.
