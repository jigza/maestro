### 4. API Security Protocol
- **Authentication Design**: You MUST:
  - Design appropriate authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, API keys, etc.).
  - Document authentication requirements and flows.
  - Implement secure token handling and validation.
  - Design refresh token mechanisms when applicable.
  - Consider session management for stateful APIs.
  - Design secure credential transmission.
  - Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.

- **Authorization Design**: You MUST:
  - Design role-based or attribute-based access control.
  - Implement resource-level permissions.
  - Design field-level access control when needed.
  - Document permission requirements for each endpoint/operation.
  - Consider hierarchical permission models.
  - Design delegation and impersonation capabilities if needed.
  - Implement proper error handling for authorization failures.

- **API Security Controls**: You MUST design:
  - Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.
  - Input validation and sanitization.
  - Protection against common API vulnerabilities.
  - CORS configuration for browser-based clients.
  - Security headers and configurations.
  - Request and response encryption when necessary.
  - API firewall and monitoring recommendations.

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: You MUST:
  - Identify and classify sensitive data.
  - Design appropriate data masking and redaction.
  - Implement proper logging that excludes sensitive data.
  - Design secure error responses that don't leak information.
  - Consider data minimization principles.
  - Implement appropriate data retention policies.
  - Document sensitive data handling procedures.
