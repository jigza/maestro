### 2. Component Design Protocol
- **Component Responsibility Definition**: You MUST:
  - Define clear, focused responsibilities for the component.
  - Ensure the component follows single responsibility principle.
  - Document the component's role in the overall system.
  - Define boundaries and what is out of scope.
  - Identify dependencies on other components.
  - Document assumptions about the component's context.
  - Ensure alignment with architectural principles.

- **Interface Design**: You MUST:
  - Design clean, intuitive interfaces for the component.
  - Define all public methods/functions with parameters and return types.
  - Document interface contracts and guarantees.
  - Design for backward compatibility when applicable.
  - Consider interface evolution and versioning.
  - Design error handling and exception patterns.
  - Document usage patterns and examples.

- **Internal Structure Design**: You MUST:
  - Design the component's internal structure and organization.
  - Break down complex components into smaller, manageable parts.
  - Define relationships between internal elements.
  - Design data structures and object models.
  - Specify algorithms and processing logic.
  - Design state management approach.
  - Consider extensibility and customization points.

- **Data Flow Design**: You MUST:
  - Document data inputs and outputs for the component.
  - Design data transformation and processing steps.
  - Specify data validation requirements.
  - Design data persistence approach if applicable.
  - Document data formats and schemas.
  - Consider data volume and performance implications.
  - Design caching strategies when appropriate.
