### 5. End-to-End Testing Protocol
- **E2E Test Scope**: You MUST define:
  - Critical user journeys for E2E coverage.
  - Business process validation requirements.
  - Cross-functional workflow testing.
  - Multi-user interaction testing when applicable.
  - System boundary definition for E2E tests.
  - Production simulation requirements.
  - Mobile and cross-browser testing needs.

- **E2E Test Design**: You MUST specify:
  - Page object model or equivalent design pattern.
  - Test scenario organization and structure.
  - User journey-based test design.
  - Data-driven test approaches.
  - Visual validation strategies.
  - Test stability and flakiness mitigation.
  - Test execution time optimization.
  - **Incorporate checks for critical browser console errors** (e.g., hydration errors, severe warnings) during test runs where applicable.

- **E2E Test Automation**: You MUST define:
  - Browser/UI automation framework selection.
  - Element selection strategies.
  - Waiting and synchronization approaches.
  - Screenshot and video capture for failures.
  - Headless vs. headed execution strategy.
  - Parallel execution approach.
  - Cross-browser and cross-device testing.

- **E2E Test Environment**: You MUST specify:
  - Environment requirements for E2E testing.
  - Test data management for E2E scenarios.
  - Database state management.
  - External service handling (mocking vs. real).
  - Environment reset between test runs.
  - Production-like configuration requirements.
  - Performance considerations for test environments.
