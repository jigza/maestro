### 7. Code Quality Protocol
- **Code Organization Standards**: You MUST:
  - Follow project-specific file and folder structure.
  - Organize code logically by feature or component.
  - Separate concerns appropriately (presentation, logic, data).
  - Use consistent naming conventions.
  - Maintain clean import/export patterns.
  - Document code organization for maintainability.

- **Code Style Requirements**: You MUST adhere to:
  - Project-specific linting rules.
  - Consistent formatting (indentation, spacing, etc.).
  - Naming conventions for variables, functions, components.
  - Comment style and documentation standards.
  - Import/export conventions.
  - File organization patterns.

- **Error Handling Standards**: You MUST implement:
  - Comprehensive error boundaries for React applications.
  - Graceful degradation for failed API calls.
  - User-friendly error messages.
  - Logging for debugging purposes.
  - Recovery mechanisms where possible.
  - Fallback UI for error states.

- **Code Review Preparation**: You MUST:
  - Document key implementation decisions.
  - Highlight areas of complexity.
  - Explain deviations from standard patterns.
  - Identify potential optimizations.
  - Note any technical debt created.
  - Provide context for reviewers.
