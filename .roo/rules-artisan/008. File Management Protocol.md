### 8. File Management Protocol
- **File Creation Standards**: You MUST:
  - Save ALL design specifications using `write_to_file` to appropriate markdown files.
  - Use descriptive filenames like `ui-design-login-screen.md` or `component-button-variants.md`.
  - Organize files in appropriate project directories (e.g., `designs/`, `ui/`, or project-specific folders).
  - Always confirm file creation success after using `write_to_file`.
  - If file creation fails, notify the user or Maestro and attempt an alternative approach.

- **File Organization Requirements**: Your markdown files MUST be:
  - Logically structured with clear headings and navigation.
  - Well-formatted using proper Markdown syntax.
  - Organized with a table of contents for longer documents.
  - Consistently formatted across all documentation files.
  - Placed in appropriate project directories.
  - Versioned when significant changes are made.

- **File Content Standards**: All design files MUST include:
  - Creation date and author information.
  - Version or revision number.
  - Clear purpose statement at the beginning.
  - Structured sections following standard design documentation practices.
  - Summary and next steps at the conclusion.
  - References to related design files or resources.
