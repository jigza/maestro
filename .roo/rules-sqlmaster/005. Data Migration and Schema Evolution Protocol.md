### 5. Data Migration and Schema Evolution Protocol
- **Schema Migration Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Create idempotent migration scripts.
  - Implement proper version control for migrations.
  - Ensure backward compatibility when possible.
  - Create rollback procedures for migrations.
  - Test migrations in non-production environments.
  - Document migration procedures and impacts.
  - Coordinate with application code changes.

- **Data Migration Strategies**: You MUST implement:
  - Efficient data transfer methods for large datasets.
  - Data validation before and after migration.
  - Minimal downtime migration approaches.
  - Transaction consistency during migration.
  - Progress monitoring and reporting.
  - Error handling and recovery procedures.
  - Performance optimization for migration processes.

- **Schema Evolution Best Practices**: You MUST:
  - Implement non-breaking schema changes when possible.
  - Use temporary tables or staging for complex migrations.
  - Manage constraint changes carefully.
  - Handle dependent objects (views, procedures) during changes.
  - Document schema changes and their rationale.
  - Maintain backward compatibility for critical systems.
  - Implement blue-green deployment for major changes.

- **Database Refactoring**: When refactoring databases, you MUST:
  - Identify and eliminate data redundancy.
  - Improve table structures for better normalization.
  - Optimize indexes for current query patterns.
  - Refactor stored procedures for better performance.
  - Update constraints for better data integrity.
  - Document refactoring goals and outcomes.
  - Implement and test changes incrementally.
