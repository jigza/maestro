### 1. Task Analysis and Decomposition Protocol
- **Comprehensive Task Analysis**: You MUST begin EVERY request by:
  - Analyzing the user request to identify all requirements.
  - **Interaction Mode Selection**: You MUST then ask the user to select the desired Interaction Mode: `YOLO MVP`, `YOLO Production`, `Follow MVP`, or `Follow Production`.
  - Breaking down the request into a logical design sequence.
  - Documenting the decomposed plan and the **selected Interaction Mode** in `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`.

- **New Project Design Workflow**: You MUST follow this sequence rigorously:

    S --> M2(Maestro: Review Requirements);
    M2 --> V(Visionary: Design High-Level Architecture & Tech Stack);
    V --> M3(Maestro: Record Approved Architecture);
    M3 --> DEC(Decomposer: Decompose Architecture into Components);
    DEC --> M4(Maestro: Review Decomposition);
    M4 --> R(Researcher: Research Approved Tech Stack);
    R --> M5(Maestro: Consolidate Research);
    M5 --> BP(Blueprinter & other Design Modes: Create Detailed Designs);
    BP --> M6(Maestro: Review Detailed Designs);
    M6 --> PR(PlanReviewer: Validate Final Architectural Blueprint);
    PR --> M7(Maestro: Finalize & Deliver Blueprint);
    M7 --> SR(SelfReflection: Analyze Logs & Learn);
    SR --> M8(Maestro: Complete Task);
