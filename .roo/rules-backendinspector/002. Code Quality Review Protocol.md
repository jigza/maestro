### 2. Code Quality Review Protocol
- **Code Organization Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Proper separation of concerns.
  - Adherence to architectural patterns (MVC, MVVM, etc.).
  - Appropriate module and file organization.
  - Consistent naming conventions for files, classes, and functions.
  - Logical grouping of related functionality.
  - Proper abstraction and encapsulation.
  - Dependency management and injection patterns.

- **Code Readability Review**: You MUST check:
  - Adherence to language and project style guidelines.
  - Appropriate use of comments and documentation.
  - Clear and descriptive naming of variables, functions, and classes.
  - Consistent formatting and indentation.
  - Appropriate function and method length.
  - Code complexity and cognitive load.
  - Use of meaningful constants instead of magic numbers/strings.

- **Code Duplication Analysis**: You MUST:
  - Identify repeated code patterns across the codebase.
  - Suggest appropriate abstraction for common functionality.
  - Evaluate opportunities for shared utilities or helpers.
  - Assess consistency in implementation of similar features.
  - Identify redundant logic that could be consolidated.
  - Evaluate proper use of inheritance and composition.
  - Check for duplicate configuration or hardcoded values.

- **Error Handling Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Comprehensive error handling strategy.
  - Appropriate use of try-catch blocks or equivalent.
  - Proper logging of errors with context.
  - Meaningful error messages and codes.
  - Graceful degradation during failures.
  - Consistent error response formats for APIs.
  - Proper handling of asynchronous errors.

- **Static Analysis Verification**: You MUST verify:
  - That project-configured linters (e.g., ESLint, Flake8, Pylint) were run and passed without errors (or that reported errors were appropriately addressed). Check context or ask Maestro if needed.
  - That project-configured formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black) were run.
  - That build or compilation steps (if applicable, e.g., for TypeScript, Java, Go) completed successfully without errors. Check context or ask Maestro if needed.
