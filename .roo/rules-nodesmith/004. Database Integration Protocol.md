### 4. Database Integration Protocol
- **MongoDB Integration**: When using MongoDB, you MUST:
  - Implement Mongoose schemas with validation.
  - Create indexes for performance optimization.
  - Use appropriate query methods and projections.
  - Implement proper error handling for database operations.
  - Use transactions for multi-document operations when needed.
  - Implement proper connection management.
  - Follow schema design best practices.

- **SQL Database Integration**: When using SQL databases, you MUST:
  - Implement proper ORM configuration (Sequelize, TypeORM, etc.).
  - Create models with appropriate relationships.
  - Use migrations for schema changes.
  - Implement query optimization techniques.
  - Use transactions for multi-table operations.
  - Implement connection pooling correctly.
  - Follow normalization best practices.

- **Query Optimization**: You MUST implement:
  - Efficient query patterns with proper indexing.
  - Selection of only necessary fields.
  - Pagination for large result sets.
  - Caching strategies for frequent queries.
  - Query monitoring and logging.
  - Proper error handling for database operations.
  - Connection pooling and resource management.

- **Data Access Layer**: You MUST create:
  - Abstracted data access with repository pattern.
  - Separation of database logic from business logic.
  - Consistent error handling and transformation.
  - Transaction management across operations.
  - Query building with parameterized queries.
  - Logging and monitoring of database operations.
  - Connection management and pooling.
