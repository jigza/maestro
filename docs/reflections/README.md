# Reflection Logs

This directory contains reflection logs generated by the Self-Reflection Protocol.

Reflection logs are automatically generated when modes detect deviations from their intended behavior or encounter situations that require self-correction.

These logs are processed by the SelfReflection mode to improve overall system performance and adherence to mode-specific rules.
