### 4. Security Implementation Protocol
- **Authentication Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement secure authentication endpoints.
  - Use appropriate security libraries and frameworks.
  - Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information.
  - Apply rate limiting and brute force protection.
  - Implement secure session management.
  - Apply proper HTTPS and security headers.
  - Implement CSRF protection for authentication forms.

- **Password Security Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Use strong, adaptive hashing algorithms (Argon2, bcrypt, PBKDF2).
  - Implement salting and appropriate work factors.
  - Enforce password complexity and length requirements.
  - Implement secure password reset functionality.
  - Check passwords against known breached password databases.
  - Implement secure password change functionality.
  - Document password security measures.

- **Token-Based Authentication**: When implementing tokens, you MUST:
  - Use secure token generation methods.
  - Implement proper token validation.
  - Set appropriate token expiration.
  - Implement token refresh mechanisms.
  - Store tokens securely on clients.
  - Implement token revocation.
  - Document token handling procedures.

- **OAuth/OIDC Implementation**: When implementing OAuth/OIDC, you MUST:
  - Follow OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications.
  - Implement secure client registration and management.
  - Use appropriate grant types for different clients.
  - Implement proper scope handling.
  - Validate redirect URIs strictly.
  - Implement PKCE for public clients.
  - Document OAuth configuration and flows.
