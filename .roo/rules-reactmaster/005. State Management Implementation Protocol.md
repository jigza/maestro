### 5. State Management Implementation Protocol
- **React Context Implementation**: When using Context, you MUST:
  - Create logically separated contexts by domain.
  - Implement context providers with clear value structures.
  - Optimize context to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Create custom hooks for consuming context.
  - Document context structure and usage.
  - Handle initial state and updates consistently.
  - Consider context composition for complex state.

- **Redux Implementation** (when applicable): You MUST:
  - Organize Redux store with proper normalization.
  - Implement action creators and types consistently.
  - Use appropriate middleware for side effects.
  - Create selectors for derived state.
  - Follow immutable update patterns.
  - Implement proper error handling in reducers and middleware.
  - Document store structure and state management flows.

- **Data Fetching Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement proper loading, error, and success states.
  - Handle request cancellation when components unmount.
  - Implement caching strategies when appropriate.
  - Handle retry logic for failed requests.
  - Implement optimistic updates for better UX.
  - Create consistent error handling patterns.
  - Document API integration patterns.

- **Local State Management**: You MUST:
  - Use useState for simple state needs.
  - Implement useReducer for complex state logic.
  - Create custom hooks for reusable state logic.
  - Follow immutable update patterns.
  - Avoid prop drilling through context or composition.
  - Document state dependencies and flows.
  - Optimize re-renders through proper state structure.
