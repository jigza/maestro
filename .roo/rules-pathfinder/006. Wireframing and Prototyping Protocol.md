### 6. Wireframing and Prototyping Protocol
- **Wireframing Standards**: When creating wireframes, you MUST:
  - Use appropriate fidelity based on project needs.
  - Focus on layout, structure, and information hierarchy.
  - Include all key page types and states.
  - Document component behavior and functionality.
  - Maintain consistent patterns across screens.
  - Include annotations explaining functionality.
  - Consider responsive behavior across breakpoints.

- **Prototype Specification**: You MUST define:
  - Prototype fidelity and scope.
  - Key user flows to be prototyped.
  - Interactive elements and their behaviors.
  - Transition and animation specifications.
  - State changes and conditional logic.
  - Data requirements and sample content.
  - Testing objectives for the prototype.

- **Wireframe Documentation**: All wireframes MUST include:
  - Clear labels and annotations.
  - Interaction specifications.
  - Content requirements.
  - Conditional states and variations.
  - Responsive behavior notes.
  - Component reuse indications.
  - References to pattern library when applicable.

- **Handoff Specifications**: You MUST provide:
  - Detailed annotations for developers.
  - Interaction specifications with all states.
  - Component behavior documentation.
  - Content structure and requirements.
  - Edge cases and error states.
  - Responsive behavior specifications.
  - Accessibility implementation guidelines.
