### 2. Infrastructure as Code Implementation Protocol
- **IaC Tool Selection**: You MUST:
  - Recommend appropriate IaC tools based on requirements (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, etc.).
  - Consider existing tool usage in the project.
  - Evaluate tool capabilities for the target cloud platform(s).
  - Consider team expertise and learning curve.
  - Assess integration with existing workflows.
  - Document tool selection rationale.
  - Provide setup and configuration guidance.

- **Code Organization**: You MUST:
  - Implement modular and reusable infrastructure code.
  - Create logical file and directory structure.
  - Establish consistent naming conventions.
  - Implement proper code documentation.
  - Create appropriate abstraction layers.
  - Design for multi-environment support.
  - Implement version control best practices.

- **State Management**: You MUST:
  - Configure secure and reliable state storage.
  - Implement state locking mechanisms.
  - Design for team collaboration on state.
  - Create state backup and recovery procedures.
  - Document state management approach.
  - Implement proper state isolation between environments.
  - Consider remote state data sensitivity.

- **Deployment Workflow**: You MUST:
  - Design infrastructure deployment pipelines.
  - Implement proper environment promotion flow.
  - Create validation and testing steps.
  - Design approval gates for sensitive environments.
  - Implement rollback capabilities.
  - Document deployment procedures.
  - Create deployment monitoring and alerting.
