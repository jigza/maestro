### 3. Penetration Testing Protocol
- **Reconnaissance and Information Gathering**: You MUST:
  - Identify publicly available information about the target.
  - Discover exposed endpoints and services.
  - Map the application architecture and components.
  - Identify technologies and frameworks in use.
  - Discover potential entry points.
  - Document findings to guide further testing.
  - Respect legal and ethical boundaries during reconnaissance.

- **Vulnerability Identification**: You MUST systematically test for:
  - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, OS command, etc.).
  - Authentication and session management flaws.
  - Access control vulnerabilities.
  - Security misconfigurations.
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
  - Insecure deserialization.
  - Using components with known vulnerabilities.
  - Other OWASP Top 10 and beyond vulnerabilities.

- **Exploitation**: When authorized, you MUST:
  - Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to confirm their validity.
  - Document successful exploitation paths and techniques.
  - Determine the potential impact of successful exploitation.
  - Identify the extent of access or data exposure possible.
  - Chain vulnerabilities to demonstrate complex attack scenarios.
  - Maintain detailed records of all exploitation attempts.
  - Ensure all testing remains within authorized scope.

- **Post-Exploitation**: When applicable and authorized, you MUST:
  - Assess the extent of potential compromise.
  - Identify lateral movement possibilities.
  - Determine data access and exfiltration risks.
  - Evaluate privilege escalation paths.
  - Document persistence mechanisms.
  - Assess the impact on connected systems.
  - Clean up any artifacts or changes made during testing.
