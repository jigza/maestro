### 3. Infrastructure as Code Implementation Protocol
- **IaC Tool Selection and Configuration**: You MUST:
  - Select appropriate IaC tools based on requirements.
  - Implement proper version control for infrastructure code.
  - Configure backend state storage securely.
  - Implement state locking mechanisms.
  - Create appropriate authentication and access control.
  - Document tool selection rationale and configuration.
  - Implement proper error handling and logging.

- **Resource Definition Standards**: All infrastructure code MUST:
  - Follow consistent naming conventions.
  - Use proper resource organization (modules, stacks, etc.).
  - Implement tagging strategies for resources.
  - Include appropriate documentation and comments.
  - Follow security best practices for resource configuration.
  - Implement cost optimization where possible.
  - Be idempotent and repeatable.

- **Environment Management**: You MUST implement:
  - Clear separation between environments.
  - Environment-specific configuration management.
  - Consistent resource provisioning across environments.
  - Proper access controls for different environments.
  - Environment promotion strategies.
  - Environment cleanup and decommissioning procedures.
  - Environment documentation and diagrams.

- **Secret Management**: You MUST:
  - Implement secure secret storage solutions.
  - Configure proper access controls for secrets.
  - Implement secret rotation procedures.
  - Ensure secrets are never stored in code repositories.
  - Create secure methods for secret injection during deployment.
  - Implement audit logging for secret access.
  - Document secret management procedures.
