# Self-Reflection Protocol Analysis

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of self-reflection capabilities across all modes in the project. The analysis was conducted as part of Phase 1 of the Self-Reflection Protocol implementation task.

## Self-Reflection Rules
The Self-Reflection Protocol consists of two key rules:

1. **Interaction Mode Adherence Rule**: Ensures modes strictly adhere to the selected interaction mode (YOLO MVP, YOLO Production, Follow MVP, Follow Production), even if Maestro provides contradictory instructions. Modes must log any violations to their reflection file.

2. **Reflection Logging Rule**: Requires modes to log significant issues, unexpected behaviors, useful workarounds, key learnings, or interaction mode violations to their reflection file.

## Current Implementation Status

Based on a comprehensive analysis of all mode files, the current implementation status is as follows:

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Modes**: 50
- **Modes with Complete Implementation**: 37 (74%)
- **Modes Needing Both Rules**: 11 (22%)
- **Special Cases**: 2 (4%)
  - Maestro: Has Self-Reflection Trigger mechanism
  - SelfReflection: Processes reflection logs

## Modes Requiring Updates (Phase 2)

The following modes need to be updated with both self-reflection rules in Phase 2:

1. AmplifyForge
2. AppSyncSpecialist
3. AWSArchitect
4. AWSSecurityGuard
5. BedrockForge
6. CloudFormationExpert
7. CognitoExpert
8. DynamoDBExpert
9. LambdaOptimizer
10. ModeSetBuilder

## Conclusion

The majority of modes (74%) already have both self-reflection rules implemented. The remaining modes (22%) will need to be updated in Phase 2 of the implementation. The standardized template created in Phase 1 will facilitate this process.

The `docs/reflections/` directory has been created to store reflection logs from all modes, and the foundation for a consistent self-reflection system has been established.
