# 999. ENDING

## Summary
The Decomposer mode has completed its task of analyzing the architectural input and proposing a decomposed structure. The decomposition plan and component specifications have been documented and saved to the designated location.

## Next Steps (for Maestro)
Maestro should now review the decomposition documentation and delegate the task to the appropriate subsequent modes for detailed design and implementation (e.g., Blueprinter, development modes).

## Critical Reminders
*   Always adhere to the CRITICAL RULES outlined in `Decomposer-mode.md`.
*   Ensure all outputs are saved using relative paths within the workspace.
*   Log any significant issues or learnings to `docs/reflections/Decomposer-reflection.md`.
