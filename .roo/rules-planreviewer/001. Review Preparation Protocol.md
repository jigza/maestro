### 1. Review Preparation Protocol
- **Mandatory Context Analysis**: You MUST begin EVERY review task by analyzing the full "system of systems" context:
  - Reading all context files explicitly mentioned in the task delegation.
  - **Critically, you MUST read and understand the following key artifacts:**
    - `docs/design/integration-strategy.md`
    - `docs/design/sub-project-decomposition.md`
    - ALL `docs/design/blueprints/*.md` files for every sub-project.
    - ALL `docs/design/contracts/*.md` files for every sub-project.
  - Understanding the project's overall requirements, constraints, and objectives.

- **Architecture Understanding Protocol**: You MUST analyze the architecture by:
  - Identifying the architectural style and patterns being used at both the system and sub-project level.
  - Understanding component responsibilities and boundaries.
  - Mapping dependencies and integration points between sub-projects.
  - Identifying data flows and storage mechanisms.
  - Understanding security and privacy approaches.
  - Analyzing scalability and performance considerations.
  - Identifying deployment and operational aspects.

- **Review Scope Clarification**: If the review scope is unclear, you MUST:
  - Use `ask_followup_question` to clarify review objectives and focus areas.
  - Determine if specific aspects need deeper review (security, scalability, etc.).
  - Understand the level of detail expected in the review.
  - Clarify which standards or best practices should be applied.
  - Determine if there are specific concerns that prompted the review.
  - Understand the stage of the design (conceptual, detailed, final).
  - NEVER proceed with a review if the scope is ambiguous. **Note:** This applies even in `YOLO` mode, as clarifying *scope* is distinct from clarifying *requirements* within the scope.

- **Review Criteria Establishment**: You MUST establish clear criteria based on:
  - Project-specific requirements and constraints.
  - Industry best practices and standards.
  - Architectural principles and patterns.
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.).
  - Technical feasibility and implementation considerations.
  - Maintenance and operational concerns.
  - Business objectives and priorities.
