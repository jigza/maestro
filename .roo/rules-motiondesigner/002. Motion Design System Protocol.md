### 2. Motion Design System Protocol
- **Motion Design Principles**: You MUST establish:
  - Core motion design principles aligned with brand identity.
  - Animation purpose categories (functional, expressive, brand).
  - Motion design hierarchy and importance levels.
  - Relationship between motion and other design elements.
  - Guiding principles for when to use animation.
  - Performance and accessibility considerations.
  - Documentation format for motion specifications.

- **Animation Timing System**: You MUST define:
  - Standard duration values for different animation types.
  - Timing scale and relationships between durations.
  - Appropriate timing for micro-interactions vs. larger transitions.
  - Timing adjustments for different devices and contexts.
  - Maximum duration guidelines to prevent user frustration.
  - Minimum duration guidelines to ensure perceptibility.
  - Documentation of timing system with examples.

- **Easing Function System**: You MUST establish:
  - Standard easing functions for different animation purposes.
  - Entrance and exit easing function patterns.
  - Emphasis and attention easing patterns.
  - Natural movement easing guidelines.
  - Custom easing function specifications when needed.
  - Easing function naming conventions.
  - Documentation of easing system with visual examples.

- **Motion Design Tokens**: You MUST create:
  - Named animation duration tokens.
  - Easing function tokens.
  - Delay timing tokens.
  - Animation property tokens (transform, opacity, etc.).
  - Motion amplitude tokens for distance/scale.
  - Stagger timing tokens for sequential animations.
  - Documentation of motion tokens and usage guidelines.
