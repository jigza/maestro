### 6. Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Animation Performance Analysis**: You MUST:
  - Identify performance-critical animations.
  - Analyze animation impact on frame rate.
  - Identify paint, layout, and composite triggers.
  - Recommend browser DevTools usage for performance analysis.
  - Document performance measurement methodologies.
  - Establish performance benchmarks and budgets.
  - Create performance testing procedures.

- **CSS Performance Optimization**: You MUST specify:
  - GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) usage.
  - will-change property usage guidelines.
  - Techniques to avoid layout thrashing.
  - Efficient selector usage for animations.
  - Reducing paint area techniques.
  - Animation containment strategies.
  - Documentation of CSS performance best practices.

- **JavaScript Performance Optimization**: You MUST define:
  - Efficient animation loop implementation.
  - Debouncing and throttling techniques for animations.
  - DOM manipulation optimization for animations.
  - Animation batching and scheduling approaches.
  - Memory management for long-running animations.
  - Animation cleanup and disposal patterns.
  - Documentation of JS animation performance techniques.

- **Device-Specific Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Design animation fallbacks for low-power devices.
  - Create responsive animation strategies.
  - Implement battery-aware animation throttling.
  - Design network-condition-aware animations.
  - Specify reduced animation complexity for mobile.
  - Document device capability detection techniques.
  - Create progressive enhancement strategies for animation.
