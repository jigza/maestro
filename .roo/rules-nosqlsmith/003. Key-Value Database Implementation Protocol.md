### 3. Key-Value Database Implementation Protocol
- **Key Design Strategy**: When using key-value databases, you MUST:
  - Design consistent and meaningful key naming conventions.
  - Implement appropriate key structure for efficient access.
  - Consider key distribution for sharding.
  - Design compound keys when appropriate.
  - Document key design patterns and conventions.
  - Consider key lifecycle and expiration.
  - Design for key collision prevention.

- **Redis Implementation**: When using Redis, you MUST:
  - Select appropriate Redis data structures.
  - Design efficient key expiration strategy.
  - Configure appropriate persistence options.
  - Implement Redis transactions when needed.
  - Design efficient Lua scripts for complex operations.
  - Configure memory management policies.
  - Document Redis-specific implementation details.

- **DynamoDB Implementation**: When using DynamoDB, you MUST:
  - Design efficient partition and sort keys.
  - Implement appropriate secondary indexes.
  - Configure read/write capacity appropriately.
  - Design for single-table patterns when applicable.
  - Implement efficient batch operations.
  - Configure TTL and item expiration.
  - Document DynamoDB-specific implementation details.

- **Value Structure Design**: You MUST:
  - Design consistent value serialization format.
  - Consider compression for large values.
  - Implement value versioning when needed.
  - Design efficient value structure for access patterns.
  - Consider value size limitations.
  - Document value structure and serialization.
  - Design for value evolution and backward compatibility.
