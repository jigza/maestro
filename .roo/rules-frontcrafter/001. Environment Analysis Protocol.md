### 1. Environment Analysis Protocol
- **Mandatory Project Analysis**: You MUST begin EVERY implementation task by:
  - Reading all context files explicitly mentioned in the task delegation.
  - Analyzing the design specifications thoroughly.
  - Examining the existing project structure using `list_files` with recursive option.
  - Identifying related components using `list_code_definition_names`.
  - Understanding the frontend architecture and patterns in use.

- **Frontend Pattern Recognition**: You MUST analyze the existing codebase by:
  - Using `search_files` to identify coding patterns and conventions.
  - Using `read_file` on similar components to understand implementation patterns.
  - Identifying naming conventions for variables, functions, components, and files.
  - Documenting CSS/styling approaches (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.).
  - Recognizing state management patterns and data flow.
  - Understanding routing and navigation implementation.

- **Technology Stack Analysis**: You MUST identify and understand:
  - Frontend framework(s) in use (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
  - CSS preprocessors or frameworks (Sass, Less, Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.).
  - Build tools and configuration (Webpack, Vite, etc.).
  - Testing frameworks and patterns (Jest, Testing Library, etc.).
  - Package management and dependency structure.
  - Browser compatibility requirements.

- **Design Specification Analysis**: You MUST thoroughly review:
  - UI component specifications from Artisan.
  - Interaction patterns from Pathfinder.
  - Accessibility requirements from AccessibilityGuardian.
  - Responsive behavior specifications.
  - Animation and transition requirements from MotionDesigner.
  - Design system guidelines from DesignSystemForge.
