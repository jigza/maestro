### 3. API Implementation Protocol
- **RESTful API Design**: When implementing REST APIs, you MUST:
  - Follow RESTful principles consistently.
  - Use appropriate HTTP methods for CRUD operations.
  - Implement proper resource naming conventions.
  - Use consistent URL patterns and parameters.
  - Implement HATEOAS when appropriate.
  - Version APIs appropriately.
  - Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger.

- **GraphQL Implementation**: When implementing GraphQL, you MUST:
  - Structure schema definitions clearly.
  - Implement resolvers with proper error handling.
  - Use data loaders for N+1 query prevention.
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization.
  - Structure mutations consistently.
  - Document schema with descriptions.
  - Implement pagination for large collections.

- **Request Validation**: You MUST implement:
  - Input validation for all request parameters.
  - Schema validation using appropriate libraries.
  - Sanitization of user inputs.
  - Consistent validation error responses.
  - Custom validators for complex business rules.
  - Validation middleware for reusable validation.
  - Documentation of validation requirements.

- **Response Formatting**: You MUST ensure:
  - Consistent response structure across endpoints.
  - Proper content type headers.
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - Pagination metadata for collection responses.
  - Error responses follow API standards.
  - Proper handling of null and empty values.
  - Consistent date and number formatting.
