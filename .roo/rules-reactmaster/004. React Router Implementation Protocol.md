### 4. React Router Implementation Protocol
- **Routing Structure**: When implementing routing, you MUST:
  - Organize routes in a logical hierarchy.
  - Implement lazy loading for route components.
  - Handle route parameters and query strings properly.
  - Implement nested routes when appropriate.
  - Create consistent route naming conventions.
  - Handle 404 and error routes gracefully.
  - Document route structure and parameters.

- **Navigation Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Use appropriate navigation components (Link, NavLink).
  - Implement programmatic navigation correctly.
  - Handle route transitions and animations.
  - Preserve scroll position when appropriate.
  - Implement breadcrumbs for deep navigation.
  - Handle back button behavior properly.
  - Implement route guards for protected routes.

- **Route Parameters**: You MUST:
  - Define clear parameter naming conventions.
  - Validate and sanitize route parameters.
  - Handle missing or invalid parameters gracefully.
  - Document parameter requirements and formats.
  - Implement optional parameters appropriately.
  - Use URL structure that follows RESTful conventions.
  - Handle parameter encoding and decoding correctly.

- **Code Splitting**: You MUST implement:
  - Route-based code splitting for performance.
  - Appropriate loading states during chunk loading.
  - Error handling for chunk loading failures.
  - Preloading strategies for anticipated routes.
  - Bundle naming and caching strategies.
  - Analytics for route changes when applicable.
  - Performance monitoring for route transitions.
