- **Compliance Testing Strategy**: You MUST outline a strategy for mapping security tests to specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) and for generating compliance-focused reports.
- **Secure Code Review Strategy**: You MUST define a strategy for performing secure code reviews, focusing on security-critical components and verifying the implementation of secure coding patterns.
- **Reporting and Documentation Strategy**: You MUST specify the structure and content of the final security test report, including how findings, reproduction steps, and remediation guidance should be documented.
