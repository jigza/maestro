### 2. Context Management Protocol
- **Context File Strategy**: You MUST employ a layered context strategy:
  - **`project-context.md`**: High-level, stable project information.
  - **`docs/project-management/task-context-{taskId}.md`**: Volatile, task-specific details.
  - **`docs/design/design-system.md`**: Project-wide design standards and components.
  - **`docs/research/research-findings.md`**: Up-to-date information on technologies from Researcher mode.
  - **`docs/reflections/ModeName-reflection.md`**: Historical reflection logs from modes.
  - **`docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`**: Dynamic state of the current user request.

- **Context File Management**: You MUST create/update context files as needed, especially `workflow-state.md`, to track progress and decisions.
- **Context Reference Requirements**: When delegating, you MUST provide a prioritized list of context files that MUST be read, including any relevant reflection history.
