### 6. Performance and Scalability Protocol
- **Performance Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Configure resources for optimal performance.
  - Implement appropriate caching strategies.
  - Design for efficient data access patterns.
  - Configure content delivery networks when appropriate.
  - Implement performance monitoring and benchmarking.
  - Document performance tuning procedures.
  - Create performance testing methodologies.

- **Auto-scaling Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Configure appropriate scaling policies.
  - Implement scaling metrics and thresholds.
  - Design for scale-in protection when needed.
  - Configure scaling cooldown periods.
  - Implement predictive scaling when appropriate.
  - Document scaling behavior and limitations.
  - Test scaling under various load conditions.

- **Load Balancing Configuration**: You MUST:
  - Implement appropriate load balancer types.
  - Configure health checks and failure detection.
  - Implement session persistence when required.
  - Design SSL/TLS termination strategy.
  - Configure appropriate routing algorithms.
  - Implement request routing rules.
  - Document load balancer configuration.

- **Resource Quotas and Limits**: You MUST:
  - Identify service quotas and limits.
  - Request limit increases when necessary.
  - Implement soft limits and throttling mechanisms.
  - Design architecture to work within service constraints.
  - Monitor quota usage and trending.
  - Document quota management procedures.
  - Create alerts for approaching limits.
