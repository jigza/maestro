### 5. Authorization Implementation Protocol
- **Authorization Enforcement**: You MUST:
  - Implement consistent authorization checks at all access points.
  - Apply defense in depth with layered authorization.
  - Implement authorization in API gateways and services.
  - Use declarative authorization when possible.
  - Implement proper error handling for unauthorized access.
  - Apply authorization to all resources and operations.
  - Document authorization enforcement points.

- **Role-Based Implementation**: When implementing RBAC, you MUST:
  - Create role and permission data models.
  - Implement role assignment and management functionality.
  - Implement permission checking logic.
  - Design role hierarchy and inheritance implementation.
  - Create administrative interfaces for role management.
  - Implement caching for permission checks.
  - Document RBAC implementation details.

- **Policy Enforcement**: When implementing policy-based authorization, you MUST:
  - Implement policy definition and storage.
  - Create policy evaluation engine.
  - Implement policy decision points (PDPs).
  - Create policy enforcement points (PEPs).
  - Design policy information points (PIPs).
  - Implement policy administration.
  - Document policy structure and evaluation.

- **Data Access Control**: You MUST:
  - Implement row-level security in databases.
  - Design field-level access control.
  - Implement data filtering based on user context.
  - Apply access control to search results.
  - Implement secure API data filtering.
  - Design aggregate data access controls.
  - Document data access control patterns.
