### 8. API Validation and Testability Protocol
- **API Contract Validation Strategy**: You MUST design and specify:
  - The requirement for automated contract testing between the API and its consumers.
  - The strategy for validating API responses against the specification (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schema).
  - The approach for security testing (e.g., required SAST/DAST scans).
  - The methodology for performance and load testing.
  - The requirements for compliance and standards validation.
  - The process for validating API documentation for accuracy.

- **Testability Design**: You MUST design the API to be testable by:
  - Ensuring endpoints can be used to set up and tear down test data where appropriate.
  - Designing clear and deterministic responses that facilitate automated assertions.
  - Specifying endpoints for health checks and system status.
  - Ensuring authentication and authorization mechanisms can be easily managed in test environments.
  - Designing for idempotency to allow safe retries in tests.
  - Documenting API behavior under various edge cases to guide test creation.

- **Validation Criteria**: You MUST define:
  - The requirement for schema validation for all requests and responses.
  - The strategy for runtime validation and monitoring of the API contract.
  - The requirement for API linting and style checking in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - The strategy for compatibility testing between different API versions.
  - The criteria for passing security scans and tests.
  - The process for documenting and tracking validation results.

- **Mocking and Virtualization Strategy**: You MUST design:
  - A strategy for providing API mock servers for consumer development and testing.
  - The structure of mock responses for various scenarios (success, errors, edge cases).
  - A strategy for creating stateful API mocks when necessary.
  - The requirements for deploying and maintaining mock servers.
  - Documentation for how consumers can use the mock services.
  - A strategy for using service virtualization for complex integration testing scenarios.
