# Code Standards

This document outlines the coding standards, conventions, and best practices to be followed throughout the project. Consistency in code style and structure is crucial for maintainability, readability, and collaboration.

## 1. General Principles

- **Readability:** Code should be easy to read and understand. Use clear variable names, consistent formatting, and add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
- **Simplicity:** Prefer simple solutions over complex ones (KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid).
- **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy to modify and extend. Follow modular design principles.
- **Consistency:** Adhere to the established standards and conventions throughout the codebase.

## 2. Language-Specific Standards

*(Placeholder: Add sections for specific languages used in the project, e.g., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc. These sections should cover formatting, naming conventions, error handling, and language-specific best practices.)*

### 2.1. Python Standards
*(Example placeholder)*
- Follow PEP 8 style guide.
- Use type hints.
- ...

### 2.2. JavaScript/TypeScript Standards
*(Example placeholder)*
- Follow a specific style guide (e.g., Airbnb, StandardJS).
- Use Prettier for automatic formatting.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.
- ...

## 3. Version Control (Git)

### 3.1. Branch Naming Conventions

Branches must follow a specific pattern to clearly indicate their purpose and link them to Jira issues.

**Format:** `{type}/{jira-key}-{short-description}`

- **`{type}`:** Indicates the purpose of the branch. Common types include:
    - `feature`: For new feature development.
    - `bugfix`: For fixing bugs.
    - `hotfix`: For critical production fixes.
    - `chore`: For maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency updates, refactoring).
    - `release`: For preparing a release.
- **`{jira-key}`:** The full Jira issue key (e.g., `PROJ-123`). **This is mandatory for `feature`, `bugfix`, and `hotfix` branches.** It is optional but recommended for `chore` branches if related to a specific task ticket.
- **`{short-description}`:** A brief, kebab-case description of the branch's content (e.g., `user-authentication`, `fix-login-error`).

**Examples:**
- `feature/PROJ-123-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/PROJ-456-fix-login-error`
- `hotfix/PROJ-789-critical-security-patch`
- `chore/update-react-dependencies`
- `chore/PROJ-101-refactor-payment-module`

### 3.2. Commit Message Format

Commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification and include the Jira issue key.

**Format:**
```
{type}({scope}): {jira-key} {subject}

{body}

{footer}
```

- **`{type}`:** Describes the kind of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`).
- **`{scope}` (optional):** Specifies the part of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `api`, `db`).
- **`{jira-key}`:** The full Jira issue key (e.g., `PROJ-123`). **This is mandatory if the commit relates directly to a specific Jira ticket.**
- **`{subject}`:** A concise description of the change (imperative mood, lowercase, no period at the end). Max 50 characters.
- **`{body}` (optional):** Provides more context, motivation, and details about the change.
- **`{footer}` (optional):** Contains metadata like `BREAKING CHANGE:` notes or references to other issues (`Refs: PROJ-456`).

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): PROJ-123 Implement password reset endpoint

Adds the API endpoint and necessary logic for users to reset their passwords via email verification.
```

```
fix(ui): PROJ-456 Correct alignment issue on login button

The login button was misaligned on smaller screens. This commit adjusts the CSS flex properties to ensure proper alignment across all supported resolutions.
```

```
chore: PROJ-101 Refactor user service for clarity

Improves code structure and readability within the user service module. No functional changes.
```

### 3.3. Pull Requests (PRs)

- PR titles should be clear and concise, summarizing the changes.
- PR descriptions MUST reference the relevant Jira issue key(s).
- Ensure all related commits are squashed or organized logically before merging.
- Address all review comments before merging.

## 4. Code Reviews

- Reviews should be constructive and focus on improving code quality, maintainability, and adherence to standards.
- Reviewers should check for correctness, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and style guide compliance.
- Authors should respond to comments promptly and address concerns collaboratively.

## 5. Testing

- Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests should be written as appropriate for the changes being made.
- Aim for reasonable test coverage, focusing on critical paths and edge cases.
- All tests must pass before code is merged.

*(Placeholder: Add more specific testing standards, framework choices, and coverage expectations.)*

## 6. Documentation

- Public APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious logic should be documented using appropriate inline comments or external documentation.
- README files should be kept up-to-date.
- Follow project documentation standards (see `/docs/standards/documentation-guidelines.md` - *if applicable*).
