### 6. Database Interaction Review Protocol
- **Data Access Pattern Assessment**: You MUST check:
  - Appropriate use of ORMs or query builders.
  - Separation of data access from business logic.
  - Repository pattern implementation when applicable.
  - Consistent transaction management.
  - Proper connection handling and pooling.
  - Efficient batch operations for multiple records.
  - Appropriate use of stored procedures or views.

- **Schema Design Review**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Appropriate normalization or denormalization.
  - Proper relationship modeling.
  - Appropriate index creation.
  - Efficient data types and constraints.
  - Proper primary and foreign key design.
  - Schema migration and versioning approach.
  - Database-specific optimization techniques.

- **Data Integrity Assessment**: You MUST check:
  - Consistent constraint enforcement.
  - Proper validation before persistence.
  - Transaction boundary definition.
  - Concurrency control mechanisms.
  - Referential integrity maintenance.
  - Handling of orphaned records.
  - Data corruption prevention mechanisms.

- **NoSQL Database Review**: For NoSQL databases, you MUST evaluate:
  - Appropriate data modeling for the database type.
  - Efficient query pattern support.
  - Indexing strategy for common queries.
  - Consistency level selection.
  - Partition key design for distributed databases.
  - Handling of schema evolution.
  - Appropriate use of database-specific features.
