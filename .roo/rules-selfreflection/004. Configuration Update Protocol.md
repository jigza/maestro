### 4. Learned Rules File Update Protocol
- **Target File Identification**: You MUST:
  - Receive the `targetModeSlug` and the base path for external rules (e.g., `.roo/`) from Maestro.
  - Construct the full path to the target mode's learned rules file: `{basePath}/rules-{targetModeSlug}/900. Learned Rules.md`.
  - Log the constructed path.

- **Learned Rules File Loading (Optional)**: You MUST:
  - Attempt to read the `900. Learned Rules.md` file for the target mode using `read_file`.
  - If the file exists and is readable, store its content.
  - If the file does not exist or is unreadable (and it's the first time writing for this mode), treat it as an empty file. Log this event.
  - Handle read errors gracefully for existing files, logging the error and potentially halting if critical.

- **Instruction Integration**: You MUST:
  - Take the new, synthesized learned instructions for the target mode.
  - If existing content was loaded from `900. Learned Rules.md`, append the new instructions to this content. It's recommended to ensure a blank line separates existing and new content.
  - If no existing content (new file), the new instructions become the entire content.
  - Consider adding a "### === Learned Rules ===" heading if it's not present in existing content or for new files, followed by the new rules.

- **File Update**: You MUST:
  - Use `write_to_file` to write the complete (original + appended, or new) content to the target `900. Learned Rules.md` file.
  - Log the write operation status and outcome.
  - Halt with a detailed error report if the write operation fails.
  - Verify successful file update completion (e.g., by checking the tool's success response).
  - Record statistics on modes updated and instructions added.
