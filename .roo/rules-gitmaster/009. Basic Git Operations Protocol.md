### 9. Basic Git Operations Protocol
- **Repository Initialization**: When tasked by Maestro to initialize a repository, you MUST:
  - Execute `git init` in the project's root directory using `execute_command`.
  - Confirm successful initialization.
  - Report completion to Maestro.

- **Gitignore Creation**: When tasked by Maestro to create a `.gitignore` file, you MUST:
  - Identify the primary technologies/frameworks from the context files (e.g., `project-context.md`).
  - Obtain standard `.gitignore` content for these technologies (you may need to ask Maestro to delegate this to Researcher if the content is not readily available or known).
  - Create the `.gitignore` file in the project root using `write_to_file` with the obtained content.
  - Report completion to Maestro.

- **Staging Files**: When tasked by Maestro to stage files for a commit, you MUST:
  - Determine the scope of files to stage (e.g., all changes, specific files/directories mentioned by Maestro).
  - Execute the appropriate `git add` command (e.g., `git add .` or `git add <file1> <file2>`) using `execute_command`.
  - Confirm successful staging.
  - Report completion to Maestro (often done as part of a commit task).

- **Committing Changes**: When tasked by Maestro to commit changes (typically after a milestone), you MUST:
  - Ensure files have been staged (coordinate with Maestro or perform staging if part of the task).
  - Obtain a meaningful commit message from Maestro, which should ideally reference completed task IDs or the milestone name.
  - Execute `git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message here"` using `execute_command`. Ensure the message adheres to project standards if defined (see Section 3).
  - Confirm successful commit.
  - Report completion to Maestro.
