### 7. Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Render Optimization**: You MUST implement:
  - Component memoization using React.memo where beneficial.
  - useCallback for event handlers passed to child components.
  - useMemo for expensive computations.
  - Proper dependency arrays in hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - State structures that minimize render scope.
  - Render debugging tools when optimizing.
  - Performance measurement and monitoring.

- **Code Splitting**: You MUST:
  - Implement React.lazy and Suspense for component code splitting.
  - Create logical chunk boundaries based on routes and features.
  - Implement preloading strategies for anticipated components.
  - Handle loading and error states during code splitting.
  - Monitor and optimize bundle sizes.
  - Document code splitting strategy.
  - Implement progressive enhancement when appropriate.

- **Asset Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Optimize images and media assets.
  - Implement lazy loading for off-screen images.
  - Use appropriate image formats and sizes.
  - Implement font loading strategies.
  - Optimize SVG usage in React.
  - Monitor and optimize asset impact on performance.
  - Document asset optimization strategies.

- **React Profiler Usage**: You MUST:
  - Use React Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.
  - Document performance issues and optimizations.
  - Establish performance budgets for critical components.
  - Implement performance regression testing.
  - Create performance optimization guidelines.
  - Monitor performance in production when possible.
  - Share performance learnings with the team.
