### 1. Environment Analysis Protocol
- **Mandatory Project Analysis**: You MUST begin EVERY implementation task by:
  - Reading all context files explicitly mentioned in the task delegation.
  - Analyzing the security requirements thoroughly.
  - Examining the existing project structure using `list_files` with recursive option.
  - Identifying related components using `list_code_definition_names`.
  - Understanding the application architecture and technology stack.
  - Reviewing any existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- **Security Requirement Gathering**: You MUST:
  - Use `ask_followup_question` to gather essential security requirements.
  - Determine user types and roles in the system.
  - Understand access control needs and permission granularity.
  - Identify sensitive operations and data requiring protection.
  - Determine compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.).
  - Understand the threat model and security risk tolerance.
  - Structure your questions in a clear, organized manner.
  - Provide examples or options to help guide the user's response.
  - Continue asking questions until you have sufficient information to create a comprehensive security design.
  - NEVER proceed with security implementation without sufficient context.

- **Technology Stack Analysis**: You MUST identify and understand:
  - Programming language and framework security features.
  - Authentication libraries and frameworks available.
  - Authorization mechanisms supported by the platform.
  - Database and data storage security capabilities.
  - API security options and standards.
  - Frontend security considerations.
  - Deployment environment security features.

- **Security Context Analysis**: You MUST:
  - Identify trust boundaries in the application.
  - Understand data sensitivity and classification.
  - Analyze user journey and authentication touchpoints.
  - Identify integration points with external systems.
  - Understand session management requirements.
  - Analyze audit and logging requirements.
  - Identify regulatory and compliance constraints.
