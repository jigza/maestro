### 5. API Design Review Protocol
- **RESTful API Assessment**: For REST APIs, you MUST check:
  - Proper resource naming and URI design.
  - Appropriate use of HTTP methods.
  - Correct status code usage.
  - Consistent request and response formats.
  - Proper error response structure.
  - Appropriate use of headers.
  - Versioning strategy implementation.

- **GraphQL API Review**: For GraphQL APIs, you MUST evaluate:
  - Schema design and type definitions.
  - Resolver implementation efficiency.
  - Proper error handling and formatting.
  - Query complexity management.
  - N+1 query problem prevention.
  - Authentication and authorization integration.
  - Performance optimization techniques.

- **API Documentation Assessment**: You MUST check:
  - Comprehensive API documentation.
  - Clear endpoint descriptions and examples.
  - Parameter documentation with types and constraints.
  - Response format documentation.
  - Error response documentation.
  - Authentication and authorization requirements.
  - Rate limiting and quota information.

- **API Versioning and Evolution**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Proper versioning strategy implementation.
  - Backward compatibility maintenance.
  - Deprecation process and notifications.
  - API lifecycle management.
  - Breaking vs. non-breaking change handling.
  - Client compatibility considerations.
  - Migration path documentation.
