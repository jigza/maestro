### 4. Scaffolding Protocol

-   **Trigger**: This protocol is executed as the final step before delivery, after the `PlanReviewer` has successfully validated the complete system architecture.

-   **Objective**: To create the physical directory structure for the "system of systems" and populate it with the core design artifacts, preparing the project for implementation.

-   **Input Artifacts**: You MUST use the following as inputs:
    -   `docs/design/integration-strategy.md`
    -   `docs/design/sub-project-decomposition.md`
    -   All sub-project blueprints (e.g., `docs/design/blueprints/*.md`)
    -   All sub-project contracts (e.g., `docs/design/contracts/*.md`)

-   **Execution Steps**: You MUST iterate through each sub-project defined in `sub-project-decomposition.md` and perform the following actions:
    1.  **Create Directory**: Create a new directory in the workspace root named after the sub-project (e.g., `./{sub-project-name}/`).
    2.  **Initialize Git**: Execute the `git init` command within the newly created sub-project directory.
    3.  **Write Artifacts**:
        -   Copy the contents of the sub-project's blueprint into a new file: `./{sub-project-name}/DESIGN_BLUEPRINT.md`.
        -   Copy the contents of the sub-project's contract into a new file: `./{sub-project-name}/CONTRACT.md`.
    4.  **Monorepo Configuration**: If the `integration-strategy.md` specifies a monorepo tool (e.g., Turborepo, Lerna):
        -   Create the necessary root configuration file (e.g., `turbo.json`).
        -   Create or update the root `package.json` with workspace definitions.
        -   Place the sub-project directories within the structure defined by the strategy (e.g., `apps/`, `packages/`).
