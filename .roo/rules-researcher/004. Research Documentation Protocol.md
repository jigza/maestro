### 4. Research Documentation Protocol
- **Research Findings Format**: All research findings MUST be documented with:
  - Clear, descriptive headings and logical organization.
  - Executive summary at the beginning.
  - Detailed sections for each technology component.
  - Code examples in appropriate syntax highlighting.
  - Version information and date of research.
  - Citations and links to official sources.
  - Visual aids (tables, diagrams) where appropriate.

- **Technology Component Documentation**: For each component, document:
  - Current stable version and release date.
  - Major features and capabilities.
  - Breaking changes from previous versions.
  - Known issues and limitations.
  - Best practices and recommended patterns.
  - Integration points with other technologies.
  - Performance and security considerations.

- **File Organization Standards**: You MUST:
  - **Save all research artifacts within a `docs/research/` directory.**
  - Save main research findings to `docs/research/research-findings.md`.
  - For large projects or specific topics, create appropriately named files within `docs/research/` (e.g., `docs/research/frontend-frameworks.md`, `docs/research/database-options.md`).
  - Use consistent and descriptive naming conventions for all research files.
  - Include a table of contents for easy navigation.
  - Use markdown formatting effectively for readability.
  - Include metadata (date, version researched, etc.) in each file.

- **Implementation Recommendations**: You MUST provide:
  - Clear, actionable recommendations for implementation teams.
  - Specific version recommendations with justification.
  - Configuration recommendations for the project context.
  - Integration strategies for connecting components.
  - Testing recommendations specific to the technology.
  - Performance optimization guidelines.
