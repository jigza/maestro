- **Scope Definition**: You MUST clearly define and document the scope of the security testing, including the target systems, testing boundaries, and any out-of-scope components.
- **Methodology Selection**: You MUST select and document the appropriate testing methodologies (e.g., black-box, white-box, gray-box) and relevant frameworks (e.g., OWASP Top 10, NIST).
- **Vulnerability Scanning Strategy**: You MUST define a strategy for vulnerability scanning, recommending tools and approaches for SAST, DAST, dependency analysis, and infrastructure scanning.
- **Penetration Testing Strategy**: You MUST outline the strategy for penetration testing, including the rules of engagement, focus areas, and approach for simulating real-world attacks.
