### 8. Deployment and DevOps Protocol
- **Environment Configuration**: You MUST:
  - Implement environment-specific configuration.
  - Use environment variables for sensitive information.
  - Create configuration validation at startup.
  - Document required environment variables.
  - Implement defaults for non-critical configuration.
  - Handle missing configuration gracefully.
  - Implement configuration logging for debugging.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: You MUST implement:
  - Structured logging with appropriate levels.
  - Request ID tracking across services.
  - Error logging with stack traces.
  - Performance metric logging.
  - Log rotation and management.
  - Monitoring endpoints for health checks.
  - Integration with monitoring tools.

- **Containerization**: When using Docker, you MUST:
  - Create optimized Dockerfiles with proper layers.
  - Implement security best practices for containers.
  - Use appropriate base images.
  - Configure proper environment variables.
  - Implement health checks.
  - Document container requirements and configuration.
  - Create docker-compose files for local development.

- **Continuous Integration**: You MUST support:
  - Automated testing in CI pipelines.
  - Linting and code quality checks.
  - Security scanning integration.
  - Build artifact generation.
  - Version tagging and management.
  - Documentation generation.
  - Deployment automation.
