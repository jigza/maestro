### QUICK REFERENCE CARD

#### 🎮 COMMON PATTERNS

```
Simple Query → Direct Resolver → DynamoDB Query → Response
Complex Logic → Lambda Resolver → Business Logic → Multi-source
Real-time Update → Subscription → Mutation Trigger → WebSocket
Batch Operation → Pipeline Resolver → Transform → Batch DynamoDB
```

#### 🔑 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. Always design schema-first, not database-first
2. Never expose database structure directly
3. When in doubt, use field-level authorization
4. Monitor everything, optimize based on metrics
5. Design for the client's needs, not backend convenience

#### ✅ PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

```yaml
Before Creating Schema:
  - [ ] All types and fields documented
  - [ ] Authorization strategy defined
  - [ ] Resolver patterns selected
  - [ ] Caching strategy planned
  - [ ] Error handling designed
  - [ ] Performance targets set
  - [ ] Integration points mapped
  - [ ] Monitoring plan created
```
