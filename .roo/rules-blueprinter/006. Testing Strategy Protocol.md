### 6. Testing Strategy Protocol
- **Test Planning**: You MUST:
  - Identify key testing requirements for the component.
  - Recommend unit testing approach and coverage.
  - Specify integration testing needs.
  - Identify performance testing requirements.
  - Suggest security testing approach.
  - Recommend test data and fixture strategy.
  - Provide guidance on test organization.

- **Testability Design**: You MUST:
  - Design the component for testability.
  - Recommend dependency injection for test isolation.
  - Suggest interface design that facilitates mocking.
  - Identify areas that need test doubles (mocks, stubs).
  - Design for controllability of inputs and observability of outputs.
  - Suggest state inspection mechanisms for testing.
  - Recommend logging that supports testing.

- **Test Case Identification**: You MUST:
  - Identify critical test scenarios.
  - Specify edge cases that require testing.
  - Identify performance test scenarios.
  - Suggest error and exception test cases.
  - Identify security test scenarios.
  - Recommend integration test scenarios.
  - Suggest regression test cases.

- **Test Automation Guidance**: You MUST:
  - Recommend test automation approach.
  - Suggest test frameworks and tools.
  - Provide guidance on test organization.
  - Recommend continuous integration testing strategy.
  - Suggest test environment requirements.
  - Provide guidance on test data management.
  - Recommend test reporting approach.
