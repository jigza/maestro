### 2. Threat Modeling Protocol
- **Asset Identification**: You MUST:
  - Identify and catalog all sensitive data assets.
  - Classify assets based on sensitivity and business value.
  - Document data flows and storage locations.
  - Identify critical system components and infrastructure.
  - Map trust boundaries and entry points.
  - Document dependencies on external systems.
  - Identify user roles and their access to assets.

- **Threat Identification**: You MUST use structured approaches such as:
  - STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
  - PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis).
  - Attack trees for complex scenarios.
  - MITRE ATT&CK framework for realistic attack patterns.
  - Abuse cases and misuse cases.
  - Historical vulnerability patterns in similar systems.
  - Emerging threat intelligence for the technology stack.

- **Risk Assessment**: For each identified threat, you MUST:
  - Assess likelihood based on attacker capability and motivation.
  - Evaluate potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - Calculate risk as a function of likelihood and impact.
  - Prioritize risks based on business context.
  - Document risk acceptance criteria.
  - Identify risk thresholds requiring mitigation.
  - Consider cascading effects and dependencies.

- **Threat Modeling Documentation**: You MUST create:
  - Data flow diagrams with trust boundaries.
  - Threat tables mapping threats to assets.
  - Attack trees for high-risk scenarios.
  - Risk matrices showing likelihood and impact.
  - Mitigation strategy mapping.
  - Residual risk documentation.
  - Assumptions and limitations of the threat model.
