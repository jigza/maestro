### 3. Documentation Protocol

-   **Primary Objective**: To document the decomposition of the high-level architecture into a list of independent sub-projects, aligned with the integration strategy.

-   **Output Artifact**: You MUST produce a single markdown file named `docs/design/sub-project-decomposition.md`.

-   **Content Requirements**: The generated document MUST contain:
    1.  **Overview**: A brief summary of how the decomposition aligns with the `integration-strategy.md`.
    2.  **Sub-Project List**: A clear list of all defined sub-projects.
    3.  **For each sub-project, you MUST specify**:
        -   `name`: A unique, machine-readable name (e.g., `user-service`, `shared-ui-library`).
        -   `role`: The sub-project's purpose (e.g., "Application", "Shared Library", "Service", "Infrastructure").
        -   `description`: A brief explanation of its responsibilities.
        -   `location`: The target directory path, as defined by the integration strategy (e.g., `apps/web-app`, `packages/utils`).

-   **Final Step**: Save the documentation using the `write_to_file` tool, ensuring the correct relative path is used.
