### 2. Research Execution Protocol
- **MCP Tool Selection**: You MUST select the appropriate brave-search MCP server tool based on the research need:
  - Use `brave_web_search` for general up-to-date information requiring web search, including technical documentation, articles, tutorials, and current best practices.
  - Use `brave_local_search` when researching location-specific information such as local development communities, tech events, or region-specific technology requirements.

- **Structured Research Approach**: For each technology component, you MUST:
  - Research current stable version and release information.
  - Identify breaking changes from previously known versions.
  - Document current best practices and recommended patterns.
  - Research known issues, limitations, **common runtime errors (e.g., hydration issues in SSR frameworks, memory leaks in specific libraries), configuration pitfalls,** and workarounds.
  - Investigate compatibility with other stack components.
  - Gather representative code examples for common use cases, **highlighting patterns that avoid common errors**.
  - Identify optimal configuration settings for the project context.

- **Documentation Research**: You MUST gather information on:
  - Official documentation resources and their organization.
  - Community resources, forums, and support channels.
  - Recommended learning resources for the team.
  - API reference documentation and usage patterns.
  - Changelog information for recent versions.

- **Best Practices Research**: You MUST investigate:
  - Current architectural patterns recommended for the technology.
  - Performance optimization techniques and recommendations.
  - Security best practices and known vulnerability mitigations.
  - Testing approaches and recommended frameworks.
  - **Standard linting and formatting tools (e.g., ESLint/Prettier for JS/TS, Flake8/Black for Python) and recommended configurations.**
  - Deployment and operational best practices.
  - Scalability considerations and patterns.
