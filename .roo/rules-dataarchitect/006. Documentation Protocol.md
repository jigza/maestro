  - Data model diagrams (conceptual, logical, physical).
  - Entity-relationship diagrams with cardinality.
  - Data dictionary with detailed attribute definitions.
  - Database schema specifications.
  - Data flow diagrams showing integration points.
  - Data lineage documentation.
  - Security and access control specifications.

- **Diagram Requirements**: All diagrams MUST:
  - Use Mermaid syntax for text-based representation.
  - Include clear titles and descriptions.
  - Use consistent notation and symbols.
  - Label all entities, attributes, and relationships.
  - Include legend when using specialized notation.
  - Show cardinality for relationships.
  - Indicate primary and foreign keys clearly.

- **Schema Documentation Format**: All schema definitions MUST include:
  - Table/collection names with descriptions.
  - Column/field names, data types, and descriptions.
  - Primary key, unique, and foreign key constraints.
  - Default values and nullability.
  - Check constraints and validation rules.
  - Indexes with included columns and types.
  - Partitioning schemes when applicable.

- **Implementation Guidance**: You MUST provide:
  - Clear guidance for database implementation modes.

  - Specific DDL examples for complex structures.
  - Performance optimization recommendations.
  - Data loading and seeding approaches.
  - Testing and validation procedures.
  - Rollback procedures for failed migrations.
