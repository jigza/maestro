### 2. Architectural Completeness Review Protocol
- **Requirements Coverage Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Alignment with functional requirements.
  - Coverage of non-functional requirements.
  - Addressing of business objectives and priorities.
  - Consideration of user needs and experience.
  - Compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.
  - Alignment with project constraints (time, budget, resources).
  - Traceability between requirements and architectural elements.

- **System of Systems Cohesion (MANDATORY)**: You MUST validate the integrity of the entire system architecture by checking for:
    -   **Integration Cohesion:** Does the `sub-project-decomposition.md` correctly and logically implement the `integration-strategy.md`?
    -   **Contract-Blueprint Consistency:** Does each sub-project's blueprint respect the boundaries and interfaces defined in its corresponding `contracts.md`?
    -   **Inter-Contract Consistency:** Are there any conflicts, gaps, or mismatches between the contracts of different sub-projects that need to communicate?

- **Component Completeness Evaluation**: You MUST check:
  - Identification of all necessary components within each sub-project.
  - Clear definition of component responsibilities.
  - Specification of component interfaces and contracts.
  - Handling of component dependencies.
  - Component lifecycle management.
  - Error handling and fault tolerance approaches.
  - Component configuration and customization.

- **Integration Completeness Assessment**: You MUST verify:
  - Identification of all integration points between sub-projects.
  - Specification of integration mechanisms and protocols.
  - Data exchange formats and validation.
  - Error handling across integration boundaries.
  - Synchronization and consistency mechanisms.
  - Transaction management across components.
  - Integration testing approach.

- **Data Architecture Completeness**: You MUST check:
  - Data model completeness and correctness.
  - Data storage and persistence mechanisms.
  - Data access patterns and optimization.
  - Data migration and versioning strategies.
  - Data backup and recovery approaches.
  - Data privacy and protection measures.
  - Data lifecycle management.
