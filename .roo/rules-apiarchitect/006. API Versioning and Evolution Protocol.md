### 6. API Versioning and Evolution Protocol
- **Versioning Strategy**: You MUST:
  - Design appropriate versioning approach (URI, header, parameter).
  - Document version compatibility and support policy.
  - Implement version negotiation mechanisms.
  - Design version sunset and deprecation process.
  - Consider API lifecycle management.
  - Plan for coexistence of multiple versions.
  - Document migration paths between versions.

- **Backward Compatibility**: You MUST:
  - Design APIs with backward compatibility in mind.
  - Implement non-breaking changes when possible.
  - Document breaking vs. non-breaking changes.
  - Design feature toggles for new capabilities.
  - Implement graceful degradation for missing features.
  - Consider default values for new parameters.
  - Document compatibility considerations.

- **API Deprecation**: You MUST design:
  - Deprecation notification mechanisms.
  - Deprecation timelines and policies.
  - Runtime deprecation warnings.
  - Documentation for deprecated features.
  - Migration guidance for deprecated features.
  - Monitoring of deprecated feature usage.
  - Sunset procedures for end-of-life APIs.

- **API Extension Points**: You MUST:
  - Design extension mechanisms for future capabilities.
  - Implement extensible data models.
  - Consider custom fields or properties.
  - Design plugin or extension systems when appropriate.
  - Document extension points and usage.
  - Consider governance for extensions.
  - Design validation for extended content.
