### 2. Frontend Performance Optimization Protocol
- **JavaScript Optimization**: You MUST identify and recommend:
  - Code splitting and lazy loading strategies.
  - Bundle size optimization techniques.
  - Efficient DOM manipulation patterns.
  - Event handling optimization.
  - Memory leak prevention.
  - JavaScript execution optimization.
  - Framework-specific performance best practices.

- **Rendering Optimization**: You MUST analyze and improve:
  - Rendering performance and frame rate.
  - Component rendering optimization.
  - Virtual DOM efficiency (for frameworks that use it).
  - CSS performance and reflow/repaint minimization.
  - Animation performance and techniques.
  - Font loading and rendering optimization.
  - Layout thrashing prevention.

- **Asset Optimization**: You MUST recommend:
  - Image optimization techniques and formats.
  - Font loading and optimization strategies.
  - CSS optimization and delivery.
  - Resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect).
  - SVG optimization techniques.
  - Video and media optimization.
  - Asset caching strategies.

- **Network Optimization**: You MUST analyze and improve:
  - HTTP request optimization and reduction.
  - Effective use of HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 features.
  - API request batching and optimization.
  - Compression implementation and settings.
  - CDN usage and configuration.
  - Service worker implementation for offline capabilities.
  - Resource prioritization strategies.
