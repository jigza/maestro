### 3. Native iOS Implementation Protocol
- **Swift/Objective-C Implementation**: When developing for iOS, you MUST:
  - Follow Apple's Swift/Objective-C coding guidelines.
  - Implement proper view controller lifecycle management.
  - Use appropriate design patterns (MVC, MVVM, etc.).
  - Implement efficient memory management.
  - Follow Auto Layout best practices.
  - Use appropriate iOS frameworks and libraries.
  - Adhere to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

- **iOS UI Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement UI components using UIKit or SwiftUI appropriately.
  - Follow iOS design patterns and conventions.
  - Implement proper view hierarchy and composition.
  - Design for different iOS device sizes and orientations.
  - Implement appropriate animations and transitions.
  - Handle safe areas and notches correctly.
  - Implement proper keyboard handling and input methods.

- **iOS Navigation**: You MUST:
  - Implement appropriate navigation patterns (tab bar, navigation controller, etc.).
  - Handle deep linking and universal links.
  - Implement proper state restoration.
  - Design efficient screen transitions.
  - Handle modal presentations appropriately.
  - Implement proper back button behavior.
  - Design consistent navigation experience.

- **iOS Performance Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Optimize table and collection views for smooth scrolling.
  - Implement efficient image loading and caching.
  - Optimize memory usage and prevent leaks.
  - Implement appropriate background processing.
  - Optimize startup time and app responsiveness.
  - Use instruments for performance profiling.
  - Document performance optimization techniques.
