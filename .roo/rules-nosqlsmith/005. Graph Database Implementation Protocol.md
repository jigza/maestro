### 5. Graph Database Implementation Protocol
- **Graph Model Design**: When using graph databases, you MUST:
  - Design appropriate node and relationship types.
  - Implement property schema for nodes and relationships.
  - Design efficient traversal patterns.
  - Consider graph partitioning for large graphs.
  - Document graph model structure.
  - Design for graph evolution and maintenance.
  - Create example graph patterns.

- **Neo4j Implementation**: When using Neo4j, you MUST:
  - Design efficient Cypher queries.
  - Implement appropriate indexes for node properties.
  - Configure relationship types and directions.
  - Design efficient graph algorithms.
  - Implement appropriate transaction handling.
  - Configure Neo4j-specific features.
  - Document Neo4j-specific implementation details.

- **Neptune Implementation**: When using Amazon Neptune, you MUST:
  - Design for both Gremlin and SPARQL if needed.
  - Implement efficient property graph model.
  - Configure appropriate instance sizing.
  - Design for Neptune's loading and query patterns.
  - Implement efficient bulk loading.
  - Configure Neptune-specific features.
  - Document Neptune-specific implementation details.

- **Graph Query Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Design efficient traversal patterns.
  - Implement appropriate index usage.
  - Optimize path finding queries.
  - Design efficient aggregation queries.
  - Implement query result caching when appropriate.
  - Document query patterns and optimization.
  - Create query performance benchmarks.
