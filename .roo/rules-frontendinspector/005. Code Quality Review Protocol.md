### 5. Code Quality Review Protocol
- **Code Organization Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - File and folder structure organization.
  - Component organization and grouping.
  - Code modularity and separation of concerns.
  - Import/export patterns and organization.
  - Consistent file naming conventions.
  - Code duplication and reuse patterns.
  - Configuration and environment setup.

- **Frontend Framework Best Practices**: You MUST check:
  - Framework-specific patterns and anti-patterns.
  - Proper use of framework features and APIs.
  - Component lifecycle management.
  - State management implementation.
  - Routing and navigation implementation.
  - Form handling and validation.
  - Error boundary implementation.

- **JavaScript/TypeScript Quality**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Type safety and TypeScript usage.
  - Modern JavaScript feature usage.
  - Asynchronous code patterns.
  - Error handling implementation.
  - Function composition and organization.
  - Variable naming and clarity.
  - Code complexity and readability.

- **CSS/Styling Quality**: You MUST check:
  - CSS organization and methodology.
  - Selector specificity and conflicts.
  - CSS performance considerations.
  - Responsive design implementation.
  - Animation and transition implementation.
  - CSS variable usage.
  - Style encapsulation and scoping.

- **Static Analysis Verification**: You MUST verify:
  - That project-configured linters (e.g., ESLint) were run and passed without errors (or that reported errors were appropriately addressed). Check context or ask Maestro if needed.
  - That project-configured formatters (e.g., Prettier) were run.
  - That build or type-checking steps (e.g., `npm run build`, `tsc`) completed successfully without errors. Check context or ask Maestro if needed.
