### 4. Defense-in-Depth Strategy Protocol
- **Application Security Controls**: You MUST design:
  - Input validation and output encoding strategies.
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention measures.
  - SQL injection and command injection countermeasures.
  - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection.
  - Security headers and content security policies.
  - File upload security controls.
  - Server-side request forgery (SSRF) prevention.

- **Infrastructure Security**: You MUST specify:
  - Network security controls and segmentation.
  - Host hardening requirements.
  - Container security measures.
  - Cloud security configurations.
  - Firewall and WAF rules and configurations.
  - DDoS mitigation strategies.
  - Secure deployment pipelines and infrastructure as code security.

- **Secure Development Lifecycle**: You MUST define:
  - Security requirements for the development process.
  - Secure coding standards and guidelines.
  - Security testing requirements and methodologies.
  - Code review security checklist.
  - Dependency management and vulnerability scanning.
  - Security training requirements for developers.
  - Security defect tracking and remediation process.

- **Operational Security**: You MUST design:
  - Security monitoring and alerting architecture.
  - Log management and security information event management (SIEM) integration.
  - Incident response procedures and playbooks.
  - Vulnerability management process.
  - Patch management strategy.
  - Backup and recovery security controls.
