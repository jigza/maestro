### 5. Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Initial Load Optimization**: You MUST implement:
  - Code splitting for large applications.
  - Lazy loading for non-critical components.
  - Efficient bundle size management.
  - Critical CSS extraction where appropriate.
  - Resource prioritization (preload, prefetch).
  - Optimized asset loading strategies.

- **Runtime Performance**: You MUST optimize:
  - Render performance (minimize reflows and repaints).
  - State management to prevent unnecessary renders.
  - Event handling with proper debouncing/throttling.
  - Memory usage and leak prevention.
  - Animation performance using appropriate techniques.
  - DOM manipulation efficiency.

- **Asset Optimization**: You MUST ensure:
  - Images are appropriately sized and compressed.
  - Modern image formats are used where supported (WebP, AVIF).
  - Fonts are optimized and loaded efficiently.
  - SVGs are optimized for size and performance.
  - Third-party resources are loaded efficiently.
  - Resource caching strategies are implemented.
