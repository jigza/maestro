### 4. Performance Review Protocol
- **Load Performance Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Initial load time and optimization.
  - Code splitting implementation.
  - Asset loading strategy.
  - Critical rendering path optimization.
  - Resource prioritization.
  - Lazy loading implementation.
  - Caching strategy implementation.

- **Runtime Performance Review**: You MUST check:
  - Render performance and unnecessary re-renders.
  - Memory usage and leak prevention.
  - Animation performance and techniques.
  - Scroll performance optimization.
  - Event handling efficiency.
  - Expensive computation handling.
  - State management performance.

- **Asset Optimization Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Image optimization (format, size, compression).
  - Font loading and optimization.
  - SVG implementation and optimization.
  - CSS and JavaScript minification.
  - Bundle size optimization.
  - Resource caching implementation.
  - Third-party resource management.

- **Performance Measurement**: You MUST check for:
  - Performance monitoring implementation.
  - Core Web Vitals optimization.
  - Performance budgets adherence.
  - Performance regression testing.
  - User-centric performance metrics.
  - Performance optimization opportunities.
  - Mobile performance considerations.
