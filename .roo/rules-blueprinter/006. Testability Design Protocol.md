### 6. Testability Design Protocol
- **Testability Design**: You MUST design the component for testability, recommending dependency injection and interfaces that facilitate mocking and isolation.
- **Test Case Identification**: You MUST identify and document critical test scenarios for the component, including:
  - Unit test cases for key logic and edge cases.
  - Integration test scenarios for component interactions.
  - Performance and security test scenarios to be considered.
- **Test Data Requirements**: You MUST specify the types of test data and fixtures that will be required to validate the component's functionality.
