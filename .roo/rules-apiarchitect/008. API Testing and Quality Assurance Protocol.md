### 8. API Testing and Quality Assurance Protocol
- **Testing Strategy**: You MUST design:
  - Unit testing approach for API components.
  - Integration testing strategy for API endpoints.
  - Contract testing between API and consumers.
  - Performance and load testing methodology.
  - Security testing approach.
  - Compliance and standards validation.
  - Documentation testing and validation.

- **Test Case Design**: You MUST:
  - Create test cases for happy paths.
  - Design negative test cases for error conditions.
  - Implement edge case testing.
  - Design authentication and authorization tests.
  - Create performance benchmark tests.
  - Implement regression test suite.
  - Document test coverage requirements.

- **API Validation**: You MUST:
  - Validate against API specifications (OpenAPI, GraphQL schema).
  - Implement schema validation for requests and responses.
  - Design runtime validation and monitoring.
  - Implement API linting and style checking.
  - Design compatibility testing between versions.
  - Implement security scanning and testing.
  - Document validation criteria and processes.

- **API Mocking and Simulation**: You MUST:
  - Design API mocking strategy for development and testing.
  - Implement mock response generation.
  - Create simulation of error conditions and edge cases.
  - Design stateful API mocks when needed.
  - Implement mock server deployment.
  - Document mock usage and configuration.
  - Consider service virtualization for complex scenarios.
