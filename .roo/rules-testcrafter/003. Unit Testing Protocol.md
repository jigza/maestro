### 3. Unit Testing Protocol
- **Unit Test Design Standards**: You MUST define:
  - Unit test structure and organization.
  - Test naming conventions and patterns.
  - Assertion strategies and best practices.
  - Test isolation requirements.
  - Mocking and stubbing guidelines.
  - Edge case and error handling testing.
  - Test performance considerations.

- **Unit Test Coverage Requirements**: You MUST specify:
  - Code coverage targets (line, branch, function).
  - Critical path testing requirements.
  - Error handling and edge case coverage.
  - Boundary value testing requirements.
  - Mutation testing considerations when applicable.
  - Coverage exclusion justifications.
  - Coverage reporting and visualization.

- **Unit Test Implementation Guidelines**: You MUST provide:
  - Test setup and teardown best practices.
  - Test data management approaches.
  - Parameterized testing techniques.
  - Asynchronous code testing strategies.
  - Private method testing approaches.
  - Test refactoring and maintenance guidelines.
  - Test performance optimization techniques.

- **TDD/BDD Approach**: When applicable, you MUST define:
  - Test-first development workflow.
  - Red-green-refactor cycle implementation.
  - Behavior specification approaches.
  - Given-When-Then pattern implementation.
  - Scenario-based testing organization.
  - Living documentation generation.
  - Collaboration workflow between developers and testers.
