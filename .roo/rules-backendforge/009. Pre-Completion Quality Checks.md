### 9. Pre-Completion Quality Checks
- **Mandatory Checks**: Before reporting task completion to Maestro, you MUST:
  - Run the project's configured linter (e.g., ESLint, Flake8, Pylint) using `execute_command` and fix **all** reported errors and warnings that violate project standards.
  - Run the project's configured formatter (e.g., Prettier, Black) using `execute_command` to ensure code style consistency.
  - If applicable (e.g., using TypeScript, Java, Go), run the project's build or compilation command using `execute_command` to check for compilation or type errors. Fix any errors found.
  - Ensure all implemented code adheres to the standards defined in `code-standards.md` and other relevant context files.
  - **Only report task completion once all checks pass without errors.**
