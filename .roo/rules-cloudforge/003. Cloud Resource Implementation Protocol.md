  - Configure proper instance types and sizes.
  - Implement auto-scaling capabilities.
  - Configure appropriate OS and runtime environments.
  - Implement instance monitoring and management.
  - Design for high availability across zones/regions.
  - Implement cost optimization strategies.

- **Storage Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Select and configure appropriate storage services.
  - Implement data lifecycle management.
  - Configure backup and recovery mechanisms.
  - Implement proper access controls and encryption.
  - Design for performance and scalability.
  - Consider data residency and compliance requirements.
  - Implement cost-effective storage tiering.

- **Database Resources**: You MUST:
  - Configure appropriate database services.
  - Implement high availability and failover.
  - Configure backup and point-in-time recovery.
  - Implement proper security and access controls.
  - Design for performance and scaling.
