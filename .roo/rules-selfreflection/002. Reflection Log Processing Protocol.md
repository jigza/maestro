### 2. Reflection Log Processing Protocol
- **Log Discovery**: You MUST:
  - Use `list_files` to identify all files within the specified reflection log directory.
  - Filter the results to retain only `.md` files.
  - Log the complete list of potential reflection logs found.
  - Report if no log files are found and conclude the task successfully.
  - Identify potential naming patterns for mode-specific logs.
  - Sort files by creation/modification date if timestamp information is available.
  - Prioritize logs based on identified patterns or naming conventions.

- **Content Extraction**: You MUST:
  - Iteratively read each identified log file using `read_file`.
  - Store successful reads in the aggregation structure with filename mapping.
  - Log successes and failures for each file operation.
  - Continue processing despite individual file failures.
  - Track read statistics for final reporting.
  - Verify minimum viable data threshold (at least one readable log).
  - Halt with detailed report if no logs could be read successfully.
  - Format extracted content for subsequent analysis.

- **Preprocessing and Organization**: You MUST:
  - Clean and normalize log content (whitespace, formatting, etc.).
  - Add source file markers to maintain traceability.
  - Group related content sections where appropriate.
  - Identify and flag potential high-priority issues.
  - Index content for efficient pattern matching.
  - Establish cross-references between related entries across logs.
  - Prepare the consolidated corpus for detailed analysis.
  - Structure the data for efficient pattern recognition.
