# Reflection Logs

This directory contains reflection logs generated by the Self-Reflection Protocol.

## Purpose

Reflection logs serve as a critical component of the self-improvement mechanism for the Maestro ecosystem. They capture:

1. **Interaction Mode Violations**: When a mode refuses instructions that contradict the selected Interaction Mode
2. **Significant Issues**: Problems encountered during task execution
3. **Useful Workarounds**: Solutions discovered for common problems
4. **Key Learnings**: Important insights gained during task execution

## Structure

Each mode has its own reflection file named according to the pattern:

```
[ModeName]-reflection.md
```

For example:
- `ReactMaster-reflection.md`
- `BackendForge-reflection.md`
- `AWSArchitect-reflection.md`

## Format

Reflection entries follow this format:

```
- [Timestamp] Task [ID]: [Description of issue/learning/violation]. [Additional context]. [Resolution or suggestion if applicable].
```

Example:
```
- [2025-05-27T21:15:30.123Z] Task implement-login-feature-20250527: Refused Maestro instruction 'Ask the user for database credentials' as it violates selected 'YOLO Production' mode. Proceeding autonomously by using environment variables.
```

## Processing

These logs are processed by the SelfReflection mode to:

1. Identify patterns of issues or inefficiencies
2. Extract valuable learnings
3. Formulate improvements to mode behavior
4. Update mode configurations with learned rules

## Usage

### For Users

- Review these logs to understand issues encountered during task execution
- Identify recurring problems that may need addressing
- Gain insights into how modes make decisions

### For Developers

- Analyze logs to improve mode behavior
- Identify opportunities for new features or capabilities
- Use as training data for enhancing mode performance

## Management

Reflection logs should be periodically processed by the SelfReflection mode to extract learnings and improve the system. This can be triggered by delegating to the SelfReflection mode with the appropriate parameters.
