### 2. RESTful API Design Protocol
- **Resource Modeling**: When designing REST APIs, you MUST:
  - Identify clear, noun-based resources from business entities.
  - Design proper resource hierarchies and relationships.
  - Use consistent resource naming conventions.
  - Define collection and singleton resources appropriately.
  - Consider resource granularity and composition.
  - Design resource representations with appropriate fields.
  - Document resource lifecycle and state transitions.

- **URI Design**: You MUST:
  - Create consistent, hierarchical URI patterns.
  - Use plural nouns for collection resources.
  - Design clean, intuitive resource paths.
  - Implement proper nesting for related resources.
  - Avoid deep nesting that complicates URLs.
  - Use query parameters appropriately for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
  - Document URI patterns and conventions.

- **HTTP Method Usage**: You MUST:
  - Use HTTP methods correctly according to their semantics.
  - Implement proper CRUD operations with appropriate methods.
  - Design idempotent operations correctly.
  - Handle bulk operations consistently.
  - Implement partial updates properly.
  - Consider custom methods when standard methods are insufficient.
  - Document method usage for each endpoint.

- **Status Code Usage**: You MUST:
  - Use appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios.
  - Implement consistent error status codes.
  - Use redirect status codes correctly.
  - Implement informational status codes when appropriate.
  - Document status code usage and meaning.
  - Ensure consistent status code usage across the API.
  - Consider custom status codes only when absolutely necessary.
