### 4. Native Android Implementation Protocol
- **Kotlin/Java Implementation**: When developing for Android, you MUST:
  - Follow Android's Kotlin/Java coding guidelines.
  - Implement proper activity and fragment lifecycle management.
  - Use appropriate design patterns (MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.).
  - Implement efficient memory management.
  - Follow ConstraintLayout and other layout best practices.
  - Use appropriate Android frameworks and libraries.
  - Adhere to Material Design guidelines.

- **Android UI Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement UI components using Android's view system or Jetpack Compose.
  - Follow Android design patterns and conventions.
  - Implement proper view hierarchy and composition.
  - Design for different Android device sizes and orientations.
  - Implement appropriate animations and transitions.
  - Handle system bars and notches correctly.
  - Implement proper keyboard handling and input methods.

- **Android Navigation**: You MUST:
  - Implement appropriate navigation patterns (bottom navigation, navigation drawer, etc.).
  - Handle deep linking and app links.
  - Implement proper state restoration.
  - Design efficient screen transitions.
  - Handle back stack management appropriately.
  - Implement proper back button behavior.
  - Design consistent navigation experience.

- **Android Performance Optimization**: You MUST:
