### 6. Security Testing Protocol
- **Authentication Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test login functionality with valid and invalid credentials.
  - Verify password policy enforcement.
  - Test multi-factor authentication flows.
  - Verify account lockout functionality.
  - Test password reset and recovery.
  - Verify session management security.
  - Test for common authentication vulnerabilities.

- **Authorization Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test access control for all protected resources.
  - Verify role-based access restrictions.
  - Test permission inheritance and propagation.
  - Verify object-level permission enforcement.
  - Test for authorization bypass vulnerabilities.
  - Verify cross-user resource access controls.
  - Test API endpoint authorization.

- **Security Vulnerability Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test for common OWASP vulnerabilities.
  - Verify protection against brute force attacks.
  - Test for session fixation vulnerabilities.
  - Verify CSRF protection.
  - Test for information leakage in error messages.
  - Verify secure communication (TLS).
  - Test for insecure direct object references.

- **Security Regression Testing**: You MUST:
  - Implement automated security tests.
  - Create security test cases for all authentication flows.
  - Develop authorization test coverage.
  - Implement security scanning in CI/CD.
  - Design security regression test suite.
  - Document security testing procedures.
  - Recommend security testing tools and approaches.
