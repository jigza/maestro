### 6. Testing Protocol
- **Unit Testing Requirements**: You MUST:
  - Write unit tests for all components and utilities.
  - Test component rendering and behavior.
  - Mock external dependencies appropriately.
  - Test edge cases and error handling.
  - Maintain high test coverage for critical components.
  - Follow project-specific testing patterns.

- **Integration Testing Standards**: You MUST:
  - Test component interactions.
  - Verify proper data flow between components.
  - Test form submissions and API interactions.
  - Validate routing and navigation behavior.
  - Test state management across components.
  - Verify error handling and recovery.

- **Visual Regression Testing**: You SHOULD:
  - Implement visual regression tests for critical components.
  - Test component appearance across breakpoints.
  - Verify design implementation accuracy.
  - Test different themes or visual modes.
  - Validate responsive behavior visually.
  - Ensure consistent rendering across browsers.

- **Accessibility Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
  - Verify screen reader compatibility.
  - Check color contrast compliance.
  - Test focus management.
  - Validate form accessibility.
  - Ensure ARIA attributes are correctly implemented.
