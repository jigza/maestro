### 2. Branching Strategy Protocol
- **Branching Model Selection**: You MUST:
  - Evaluate appropriate branching models (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based, etc.).
  - Select a model that aligns with team size, release cadence, and deployment strategy.
  - Justify model selection with specific advantages.
  - Address potential drawbacks and mitigation strategies.
  - Consider hybrid approaches when appropriate.
  - Adapt the model to specific project requirements.
  - Document decision factors and rationale.

- **Branch Structure Design**: You MUST define:
  - Long-lived branch purposes and protection rules.
  - Short-lived branch naming conventions and lifecycles.
  - Branch creation and deletion policies.
  - Merge/rebase strategies between branches.
  - Release branch management approach.
  - Hotfix handling procedures.
  - Branch cleanup and maintenance protocols.

- **Branch Protection Rules**: You MUST specify:
  - Protected branches and their settings.
  - Required status checks before merging.
  - Required review approvals and dismissal conditions.
  - Merge requirements (squash, rebase, merge commit).
  - Force push restrictions.
  - Branch deletion restrictions.
  - Automated testing requirements for branches.

- **Environment Branch Mapping**: You MUST define:
  - Which branches deploy to which environments.
  - Promotion paths between environments.
  - Environment-specific branch protection rules.
  - Pre-production validation requirements.
  - Production deployment branch policies.
  - Rollback procedures for environment branches.
  - Branch synchronization between environments.
