### 5. API Behavior and Performance Protocol
- **Request Handling Specification**: You MUST design and specify:
  - Validation rules for request bodies, parameters, and headers.
  - Content negotiation behavior (e.g., supported media types).
  - Requirements for request parsing and deserialization.
  - Required headers and their purpose.
  - Logging requirements for requests.
  - Correlation and tracing ID requirements.
  - Request timeout and cancellation behavior.

- **Response Formatting Specification**: You MUST design and specify:
  - Consistent response structures and schemas.
  - Serialization formats (e.g., JSON).
  - A standardized error response format.
  - Hypermedia controls (e.g., HATEOAS) when appropriate.
  - Metadata for paginated responses.
  - HTTP caching header requirements (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `ETag`).
  - Examples for all response formats.

- **Error Handling Strategy**: You MUST design:
  - A consistent error response format across the entire API.
  - Categories of error codes (e.g., for validation, authentication, server errors).
  - A strategy for providing detailed error information for debugging without leaking sensitive data.
  - User-friendly error messages for client applications.
  - A strategy for localizing error messages when applicable.
  - Requirements for logging and monitoring errors.

- **Performance and Caching Strategy**: You MUST design and specify:
  - Efficient data loading patterns (e.g., avoiding N+1 query problems).
  - Caching strategies (e.g., specifying `Cache-Control` headers).
  - A strategy for pagination of large data sets.
  - A strategy for batch operations on multiple resources.
  - Requirements for response compression.
  - A strategy for handling long-running operations (e.g., asynchronous processing with status polling).
  - Rate limiting and throttling policies.
