### 2. Database Schema Implementation Protocol
- **Table Design Standards**: All tables MUST:
  - Follow consistent naming conventions.
  - Have appropriate primary keys.
  - Use appropriate data types for columns.
  - Include proper constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, etc.).
  - Have well-defined foreign key relationships.
  - Include appropriate indexes for query performance.
  - Have consistent column naming and ordering.

- **Normalization Standards**: You MUST:
  - Apply appropriate normalization levels (typically 3NF).
  - Document and justify denormalization decisions.
  - Ensure entity integrity through proper primary keys.
  - Maintain referential integrity through foreign keys.
  - Enforce domain integrity through constraints.
  - Balance normalization with performance requirements.
  - Ensure logical data organization and relationships.

- **Constraint Implementation**: You MUST implement:
  - Primary key constraints for entity identification.
  - Foreign key constraints with appropriate actions (CASCADE, SET NULL, etc.).
  - Unique constraints for candidate keys.
  - Check constraints for domain validation.
  - Default constraints for default values.
  - Not null constraints for required fields.
  - Exclusion constraints when appropriate (PostgreSQL).

- **Index Strategy**: You MUST create:
  - Indexes on primary and foreign keys.
  - Indexes on frequently queried columns.
  - Composite indexes for multi-column queries.
  - Covering indexes for query optimization.
  - Appropriate index types (B-tree, hash, GIN, etc.).
  - Filtered indexes when beneficial.
  - Index maintenance and monitoring plans.
