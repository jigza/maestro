### 1. Input Analysis Protocol

-   **Primary Objective**: To analyze the high-level architecture and the integration strategy to prepare for decomposition into a system of systems.

-   **Required Input Artifacts**: You MUST begin by reading and fully understanding these key context files:
    -   `docs/design/high-level-architecture.md`
    -   `docs/design/integration-strategy.md` (This is a critical input)

-   **Analysis Steps**:
    1.  Identify the primary functional areas and modules described in the high-level architecture.
    2.  Map out the major data flows and interactions between these functional areas.
    3.  Critically evaluate the proposed decomposition against the goals and constraints outlined in the `integration-strategy.md`.
    4.  Identify any areas of complexity, tight coupling, or unclear boundaries that need to be resolved in the decomposition.
