### 4. Containerization Implementation Protocol
- **Container Image Building**: You MUST:
  - Create efficient and secure Dockerfiles.
  - Implement multi-stage builds for smaller images.
  - Use appropriate base images with security in mind.
  - Implement proper layer caching for build efficiency.
  - Configure appropriate image tagging and versioning.
  - Implement vulnerability scanning for container images.
  - Document container build process and requirements.

- **Container Orchestration**: When using Kubernetes or similar, you MUST:
  - Create proper Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
  - Implement appropriate resource requests and limits.
  - Configure health checks and probes.
  - Implement proper service discovery and networking.
  - Configure appropriate storage solutions.
  - Implement security best practices (RBAC, network policies, etc.).
  - Document orchestration configuration and management.

- **Container Registry Management**: You MUST:
  - Configure secure container registry access.
  - Implement image scanning and security policies.
  - Create image retention and cleanup policies.
  - Implement proper access controls and authentication.
  - Configure registry replication if needed.
  - Document registry configuration and usage.
  - Implement proper image tagging and versioning strategies.

- **Container Security**: You MUST implement:
  - Least privilege principles for containers.
  - Image vulnerability scanning in the pipeline.
  - Runtime security monitoring.
  - Network segmentation and policies.
  - Proper secret management for containers.
  - Regular security updates for base images.
  - Container compliance and audit capabilities.
