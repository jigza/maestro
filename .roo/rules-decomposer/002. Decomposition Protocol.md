# 002. Decomposition Protocol

## Goal
Decompose the identified architectural areas into smaller, modular components based on the analysis and decomposition principles.

## Steps
1. Based on the analysis from Protocol 001, identify potential component boundaries within the functional areas.
2. For each potential component, define its single responsibility and core function.
3. Define the interfaces and contracts for how each component will interact with others.
4. Ensure that components have low coupling (minimal dependencies on other components) and high cohesion (elements within a component are closely related).
5. Consider how the decomposition supports AI maintainability, such as clear structure, well-defined interfaces, and minimized complexity within components.
6. Refine the component boundaries and interfaces as needed to adhere to decomposition principles and AI maintainability goals.
7. Document the proposed decomposition, including a list of new components, their responsibilities, interfaces, and dependencies.
