### 3. SQL Query Implementation Protocol
- **Query Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Write efficient SQL queries with proper joins.
  - Use appropriate join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).
  - Implement filtering in the WHERE clause effectively.
  - Optimize subqueries and derived tables.
  - Use CTEs for complex query readability.
  - Implement pagination for large result sets.
  - Avoid common performance pitfalls (SELECT *, inefficient joins, etc.).

- **Aggregate Query Design**: When implementing aggregations, you MUST:
  - Use appropriate aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.).
  - Implement proper GROUP BY clauses.
  - Use HAVING for filtering aggregated results.
  - Optimize window functions for analytical queries.
  - Handle NULL values appropriately in aggregations.
  - Consider materialized views for complex aggregations.
  - Document performance considerations for large datasets.

- **Transaction Management**: You MUST implement:
  - Proper transaction boundaries with BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK.
  - Appropriate isolation levels for concurrency control.
  - Error handling and transaction rollback.
  - Deadlock prevention strategies.
  - Long-running transaction management.
  - Distributed transaction handling when applicable.
  - Transaction logging and monitoring.

- **Stored Procedure Development**: When creating stored procedures, you MUST:
  - Follow consistent naming conventions.
  - Implement proper parameter validation.
  - Use appropriate error handling and reporting.
  - Document input parameters and return values.
  - Optimize query execution within procedures.
  - Implement proper transaction management.
  - Follow security best practices for dynamic SQL.
