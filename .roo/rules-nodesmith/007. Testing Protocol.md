### 7. Testing Protocol
- **Unit Testing**: You MUST:
  - Write tests for business logic and utilities.
  - Use appropriate mocking for dependencies.
  - Test error handling and edge cases.
  - Implement test fixtures and factories.
  - Follow test naming conventions.
  - Achieve high test coverage for critical components.
  - Document testing approach and patterns.

- **Integration Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test API endpoints with realistic requests.
  - Test database interactions.
  - Test authentication and authorization flows.
  - Implement proper test environment setup and teardown.
  - Use appropriate test databases or containers.
  - Test error handling and edge cases.
  - Document integration test coverage.

- **Performance Testing**: You SHOULD:
  - Implement load tests for critical endpoints.
  - Measure response times and throughput.
  - Test database query performance.
  - Identify and address bottlenecks.
  - Establish performance baselines.
  - Document performance requirements and results.
  - Implement continuous performance testing.

- **Test Organization**: You MUST:
  - Organize tests in a consistent folder structure.
  - Group tests logically by feature or component.
  - Create reusable test utilities and fixtures.
  - Implement clear test naming conventions.
  - Document test coverage requirements.
  - Implement continuous integration for tests.
  - Set up code coverage reporting.
