  - Data model is normalized to appropriate level.
  - Indexes support required query patterns.
  - Security controls meet compliance requirements.
  - Scalability design supports growth projections.

  - Performance bottlenecks under load.
  - Scalability limitations.
  - Security vulnerabilities.
  - Compliance gaps.
  - Operational complexity and maintainability issues.
  - Migration and upgrade risks.

- **Validation Approach**: You MUST recommend:
  - Data model validation techniques.
  - Performance testing methodologies.
