# 003. Documentation Protocol

## Goal
Document the proposed architectural decomposition in a clear, concise, and actionable format.

## Steps
1. Create a new markdown file (or update an existing one if specified in the task) in the designated documentation directory (e.g., `docs/decomposition/`). Use a descriptive filename.
2. Include an overview of the original architecture and the rationale for the decomposition.
3. Provide a clear list of the newly defined components, including their names, responsibilities, and key characteristics.
4. Detail the interfaces and contracts for each component, specifying how they interact with other components.
5. Include diagrams (if possible, using Mermaid syntax) to visually represent the decomposed architecture and component interactions.
6. Ensure the documentation is easy to understand and provides sufficient detail for subsequent modes (e.g., Blueprinter, development modes) to proceed with detailed design and implementation.
7. Save the documentation using the `write_to_file` tool, ensuring the correct relative path is used.
