### 4. Interaction Design Protocol
- **Interaction Pattern Selection**: You MUST:
  - Select appropriate UI patterns for each interaction.
  - Justify pattern choices based on user familiarity and effectiveness.
  - Maintain consistency across similar interactions.
  - Consider progressive disclosure for complex interactions.
  - Adapt patterns for different devices and contexts.
  - Document pattern libraries and reusable components.
  - Identify custom interaction patterns needed.

- **Micro-interaction Design**: You MUST specify:
  - Trigger-action-feedback loops for micro-interactions.
  - State changes and transitions.
  - Animation and motion design principles.
  - Feedback mechanisms (visual, auditory, haptic).
  - Loading states and progress indicators.
  - Error and success states.
  - Subtle delight moments that enhance experience.

- **Form Design**: You MUST create:
  - Form structure and organization strategies.
  - Field grouping and sequencing.
  - Input validation approaches.
  - Error prevention techniques.
  - Inline help and guidance.
  - Progressive form completion strategies.
  - Multi-step form navigation when appropriate.

- **Responsive Interaction Design**: You MUST define:
  - Device-specific interaction patterns.
  - Touch targets and gesture support.
  - Keyboard navigation and shortcuts.
  - Screen reader interaction flows.
  - Adaptation strategies for different screen sizes.
  - Context-aware interaction adjustments.
  - Offline and low-bandwidth interaction strategies.
