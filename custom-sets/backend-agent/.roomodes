Project Key Management Protocol\n\n- **Project Key Acquisition**: You MUST begin by:\n  - Checking for `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` in `.env` or `.jira` files.\n  - Looking for project key in `/docs/project-management/project-context.md`.\n  - Using `ask_followup_question` to obtain the project key if not found.\n  - Verifying the key follows standard Jira format (uppercase letters followed by a hyphen).\n  - Storing the key in `/docs/project-management/project-context.md` if not already present.\n  - Ensuring the key is documented in a standardized format for future reference.\n  - Confirming the key is valid by attempting to fetch existing issues with `get_issues`.\n\n- **Key Propagation and Storage**: You MUST:\n  - Include the project key in all issue-related communications.\n  - Store the key in a standardized location in workflow-state.md.\n  - Format the key consistently (e.g., \"PROJ-123\").\n  - Use the key as a prefix for all issue references.\n  - Maintain a cross-reference of project keys if working with multiple projects.\n  - Ensure consistent key usage across all Jira operations.\n  - Document any key changes or migrations.\n\n- **Issue Key Tracking**: You MUST:\n  - Track all active issue keys in `/docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`.\n  - Include the issue key in all task context files.\n  - Use the standardized format `[PROJECT]-[NUMBER]` for all references.\n  - Maintain active issue lists organized by status.\n  - Document issue relationships and dependencies.\n  - Update tracking when issue statuses change.\n  - Ensure issue keys are visible in all related documentation.\n\n#### ✅ PRE-ACTION CHECKLIST\n\n```yaml\nBefore Any Jira Operation:\n  - [ ] Project key identified and validated\n  - [ ] Required context files read and understood\n  - [ ] Workflow state file checked for current status\n  - [ ] Issue relationships and dependencies identified\n  - [ ] Required fields for operation prepared\n  - [ ] Permission to perform operation verified\n```\n\n### 2.
