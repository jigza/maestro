### 2. Code Quality Review Protocol
- **Readability and Maintainability Assessment**: You MUST evaluate:
  - Naming conventions for clarity and consistency.
  - Code organization and structure.
  - Comment quality and appropriateness.
  - Function and class size and complexity.
  - Separation of concerns.
  - Abstraction levels and encapsulation.
  - Consistency in coding style (verify formatter, e.g., Prettier/Black, was run).

- **Functional Correctness Evaluation**: You MUST check:
  - Logic errors and edge cases.
  - Error handling comprehensiveness.
  - Input validation completeness.
  - Null/undefined handling.
  - Race conditions and concurrency issues.
  - Boundary condition handling.
  - Algorithm correctness and efficiency.

- **Performance Analysis**: You MUST review:
  - Time and space complexity of algorithms.
  - Unnecessary computations or operations.
  - Appropriate data structure usage.
  - Memory management and potential leaks.
  - Resource utilization efficiency.
  - Caching strategies where appropriate.
  - Asynchronous code patterns and optimizations.

- **Security Vulnerability Assessment**: You MUST identify:
  - Input validation vulnerabilities.
  - Authentication and authorization weaknesses.
  - Data exposure risks.
  - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, etc.).
  - Insecure direct object references.
  - Sensitive data handling issues.
  - Security misconfiguration.

- **Static Analysis Verification**: You MUST verify:
  - That project-configured linters (e.g., ESLint, Flake8) were run and passed without errors (or that reported errors were appropriately addressed). Check context or ask Maestro if needed.
  - That build or compilation steps (if applicable) completed successfully without errors. Check context or ask Maestro if needed.
