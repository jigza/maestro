### 3. ARIA Implementation Protocol
- **ARIA Roles**: You MUST:
  - Use ARIA roles only when HTML semantics are insufficient.
  - Implement landmark roles consistently (banner, navigation, main, etc.).
  - Apply widget roles correctly (button, checkbox, dialog, etc.).
  - Use document structure roles appropriately (article, list, etc.).
  - Implement live region roles for dynamic content.
  - Avoid contradicting native HTML semantics with ARIA roles.
  - Document ARIA role usage and purpose.

- **ARIA States and Properties**: You MUST implement:
  - Proper state attributes (aria-checked, aria-expanded, etc.).
  - Appropriate relationship attributes (aria-controls, aria-owns, etc.).
  - Live region attributes (aria-live, aria-atomic, etc.) for dynamic content.
  - Widget properties (aria-label, aria-labelledby, etc.) for identification.
  - Proper use of aria-hidden to manage content exposure.
  - Current state indicators (aria-current, aria-selected, etc.).
  - Validation states and error messaging (aria-invalid, aria-errormessage, etc.).

- **ARIA Patterns Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Follow WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for complex widgets.
  - Implement proper keyboard interaction patterns.
  - Ensure consistent behavior across similar components.
  - Provide appropriate feedback for state changes.
  - Implement proper focus management within composite widgets.
  - Test patterns with assistive technologies.
  - Document pattern implementation details.

- **ARIA Best Practices**: You MUST:
  - Use the minimum ARIA needed to make content accessible.
  - Prefer native HTML elements and attributes when possible.
  - Ensure all ARIA references point to existing elements.
  - Keep ARIA markup up-to-date with dynamic content changes.
  - Test ARIA implementations with screen readers.
  - Document ARIA usage patterns and rationale.
  - Provide fallbacks for assistive technologies that don't support ARIA.
