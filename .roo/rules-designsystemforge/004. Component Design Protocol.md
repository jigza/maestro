### 4. Component Design Protocol
- **Component Identification**: You MUST:
  - Analyze user interfaces to identify common patterns.
  - Categorize components by function and complexity.
  - Prioritize components based on usage frequency.
  - Identify component relationships and dependencies.
  - Determine component variants and states.
  - Document component usage contexts.
  - Create a component inventory and roadmap.

- **Component Specification**: For each component, you MUST define:
  - Purpose and usage guidelines.
  - Anatomy and constituent elements.
  - States and variants with visual examples.
  - Behavior and interaction patterns.
  - Responsive behavior across breakpoints.
  - Accessibility requirements and implementation.
  - Content guidelines and constraints.

- **Component Relationships**: You MUST document:
  - Component composition patterns.
  - Parent-child relationships.
  - Compound component structures.
  - Layout and spacing relationships.
  - Interaction between related components.
  - State propagation between components.
  - Compatibility and exclusivity rules.

- **Component Evolution**: You MUST establish:
  - Component versioning strategy.
  - Deprecation policies and procedures.
  - Backward compatibility guidelines.
  - Migration paths for breaking changes.
  - Feature addition processes.
  - Bug fix and patch management.
  - Experimental component handling.
