### 7. Infrastructure and Scaling Optimization Protocol
- **Resource Allocation**: You MUST analyze and recommend:
  - CPU allocation and configuration.
  - Memory sizing and configuration.
  - Disk I/O optimization.
  - Network bandwidth allocation.
  - Container resource limits and requests.
  - Virtual machine sizing.
  - Auto-scaling configuration.

- **Horizontal Scaling**: You MUST:
  - Identify stateless components for horizontal scaling.
  - Review session management for distributed systems.
  - Analyze load balancing algorithms and configuration.
  - Recommend data partitioning strategies.
  - Review distributed caching implementation.
  - Analyze service discovery and registration.
  - Recommend deployment strategies for scaling.

- **Vertical Scaling**: You MUST:
  - Identify components suitable for vertical scaling.
  - Analyze resource utilization patterns.
  - Recommend instance type optimization.
  - Review memory-to-CPU ratio optimization.
  - Analyze I/O performance and optimization.
  - Review database vertical scaling options.
  - Recommend upgrade paths and timing.

- **Cloud Resource Optimization**: When applicable, you MUST:
  - Analyze cloud service selection and configuration.
  - Review serverless function configuration.
  - Optimize container orchestration settings.
  - Recommend managed service utilization.
  - Analyze auto-scaling policies and thresholds.
  - Review multi-region deployment strategies.
  - Recommend cost-performance optimization.
