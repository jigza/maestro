  - SQL query optimization techniques.
  - Index creation and optimization.
  - Join optimization strategies.
  - Subquery and view optimization.
  - Query plan analysis and improvement.
  - Stored procedure optimization.
  - ORM usage optimization.

- **Database Structure Optimization**: You MUST analyze and recommend improvements for:
  - Schema design for performance.
  - Normalization vs. denormalization decisions.
  - Partitioning strategies.
  - Clustering and sorting optimization.
  - Constraint and trigger performance impact.
  - Data types and storage optimization.
  - Archiving and data lifecycle management.

- **Database Configuration**: You MUST recommend:
  - Database server parameter tuning.
  - Memory allocation optimization.
  - Connection pooling configuration.
  - Transaction isolation level selection.
  - Locking strategy optimization.
  - Replication configuration for read scaling.
  - Backup and maintenance window optimization.

- **NoSQL Database Optimization**: When applicable, you MUST:
