# Self-Reflection Implementation Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the current state of self-reflection capabilities across modes and identifies priority modes for initial implementation in Phase 1 of the Self-Reflection Protocol implementation task.

## Modes with Existing Self-Reflection Capabilities

Based on initial analysis, the following modes already have some form of self-reflection capabilities:

1. **ReactMaster** - Has both the Interaction Mode Adherence Rule and Reflection Logging Rule fully implemented
2. **Maestro** - Has the Self-Reflection Trigger mechanism and does not need the specific self-reflection rules as it is the central coordinator
3. **GitMaster** - Has both the Interaction Mode Adherence Rule and Reflection Logging Rule fully implemented
4. **Researcher** - Had the Reflection Logging Rule already implemented, now has both rules
5. **FrontCrafter** - Has both the Interaction Mode Adherence Rule and Reflection Logging Rule fully implemented
6. **BackendForge** - Has both the Interaction Mode Adherence Rule and Reflection Logging Rule fully implemented
7. **Documentarian** - Has both the Interaction Mode Adherence Rule and Reflection Logging Rule fully implemented
8. **CodeReviewer** - Has both the Interaction Mode Adherence Rule and Reflection Logging Rule fully implemented

## Priority Modes for Initial Updates (Phase 1)

The following modes have been identified as priorities for the initial implementation of self-reflection capabilities:

1. ~~**Maestro**~~ - Central coordinator for all modes, already has appropriate self-reflection capabilities and does not need the specific rules
2. **ModeBuilder** - Currently being used for the self-reflection implementation task
3. **ErrorManager** - Critical for error handling and resolution
4. ~~**GitMaster**~~ - Already has both self-reflection rules implemented
5. **JiraManager** - Updated with both self-reflection rules
6. ~~**Researcher**~~ - Updated with Interaction Mode Adherence Rule (already had Reflection Logging Rule)
7. ~~**FrontCrafter**~~ - Already has both self-reflection rules implemented
8. ~~**BackendForge**~~ - Already has both self-reflection rules implemented
9. ~~**Documentarian**~~ - Already has both self-reflection rules implemented
10. ~~**CodeReviewer**~~ - Already has both self-reflection rules implemented

## Selection Criteria

The priority modes were selected based on the following criteria:

1. Core modes that are used frequently across projects
2. Modes mentioned in the current workflow state document
3. Modes that are part of critical workflows
4. Modes that handle essential project functions (git, issue tracking, documentation)

## Implementation Plan for Phase 1

1. Update the template modes first (ReactMaster already has the rules)
2. Implement self-reflection rules in Maestro mode
3. Implement self-reflection rules in the remaining priority modes
4. Verify that all updated modes can properly log reflections to the appropriate files
5. Create a test case for verifying reflection functionality

## Remaining Modes for Phase 2

All other modes not listed in the priority list will be updated in Phase 2 of the implementation.
