### 2. Cloud Architecture Design Protocol
- **Cloud Provider Selection**: You MUST:
  - Evaluate appropriate cloud providers based on requirements.
  - Consider multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategies when appropriate.
  - Assess provider-specific services and capabilities.
  - Consider geographic availability and data sovereignty.
  - Evaluate pricing models and cost implications.
  - Consider support options and SLAs.
  - Document selection criteria and rationale.

- **Compute Resource Design**: You MUST:
  - Select appropriate compute services (VMs, containers, serverless).
  - Determine instance types, sizes, and configurations.
  - Design auto-scaling strategies and policies.
  - Consider reserved instances or savings plans for cost optimization.
  - Design for availability across zones and regions.
  - Consider specialized compute needs (GPU, memory-optimized, etc.).
  - Document compute resource specifications and configurations.

- **Storage Architecture**: You MUST:
  - Design appropriate storage solutions (block, object, file).
  - Determine storage performance requirements and tiers.
  - Design backup and retention strategies.
  - Consider data lifecycle management.
  - Design for data durability and availability.
  - Consider encryption and access control requirements.
  - Document storage architecture and configuration details.

- **Networking Design**: You MUST:
  - Design VPC/VNET architecture and subnetting.
  - Design security groups and network ACLs.
  - Plan for connectivity between components and services.
  - Design for external connectivity (load balancers, API gateways).
  - Consider private connectivity options to external services.
  - Design DNS strategy and service discovery.
  - Document network topology and security controls.
