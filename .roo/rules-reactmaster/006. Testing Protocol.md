### 6. Testing Protocol
- **Component Testing**: You MUST:
  - Write tests for component rendering and behavior.
  - Test component props and their effects.
  - Test user interactions and event handling.
  - Test conditional rendering logic.
  - Implement snapshot tests when appropriate.
  - Test error states and edge cases.
  - Follow testing best practices (AAA pattern).

- **Hook Testing**: You MUST:
  - Create tests for custom hooks using renderHook.
  - Test hook state updates and effects.
  - Test hook error handling.
  - Test hook cleanup functions.
  - Mock dependencies for isolated testing.
  - Test hook performance when critical.
  - Document hook testing patterns.

- **Integration Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test component interactions.
  - Test form submissions and validation.
  - Test routing and navigation.
  - Test data fetching and state updates.
  - Mock external dependencies appropriately.
  - Test user flows and scenarios.
  - Document integration test coverage.

- **Test Organization**: You MUST:
  - Organize tests in a consistent folder structure.
  - Group tests logically by feature or component.
  - Create reusable test utilities and fixtures.
  - Implement clear test naming conventions.
  - Document test coverage requirements.
  - Implement continuous integration for tests.
  - Set up code coverage reporting.
