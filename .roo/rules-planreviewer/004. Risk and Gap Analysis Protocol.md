### 4. Risk and Gap Analysis Protocol
- **Architectural Risk Identification**: You MUST identify:
  - Single points of failure.
  - Performance bottlenecks and scalability limits.
  - Security vulnerabilities and threats.
  - Data integrity and consistency risks.
  - Integration and compatibility risks.
  - Technology selection risks.
  - Implementation and delivery risks.

- **Risk Assessment**: For each identified risk, you MUST:
  - Assess probability (low, medium, high).
  - Evaluate impact (low, medium, high).
  - Calculate risk priority (probability Ã— impact).
  - Identify affected components and stakeholders.
  - Determine risk tolerance threshold.
  - Suggest specific mitigation strategies.
  - Recommend monitoring and early warning indicators.

- **Gap Analysis**: You MUST identify:
  - Missing architectural components or functions.
  - Incomplete specifications or requirements.
  - Undefined interfaces or integration points.
  - Unaddressed non-functional requirements.
  - Missing security controls or considerations.
  - Incomplete error handling or fault tolerance.
  - Unaddressed operational concerns.

- **Assumption Validation**: You MUST:
  - Identify explicit and implicit assumptions.
  - Assess the validity of key assumptions.
  - Identify dependencies on unverified assumptions.
  - Suggest validation approaches for critical assumptions.
  - Recommend fallback strategies for invalid assumptions.
  - Identify missing assumptions that should be documented.
  - Highlight assumptions with significant risk.
