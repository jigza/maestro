### 4. Reliability and Resilience Protocol
- **High Availability Design**: You MUST:
  - Design for redundancy across availability zones.
  - Specify load balancing and traffic distribution.
  - Design stateless services where possible.
  - Plan for session persistence when needed.
  - Design database replication and failover.
  - Specify health checks and service discovery.
  - Document availability SLAs and targets.

- **Disaster Recovery Planning**: You MUST:
  - Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
  - Design backup and restoration procedures.
  - Specify cross-region replication when needed.
  - Design disaster recovery testing procedures.
  - Create failover and failback procedures.
  - Document disaster recovery runbooks.
  - Specify recovery validation processes.

- **Fault Tolerance**: You MUST design:
  - Circuit breaker patterns for service dependencies.
  - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
  - Graceful degradation capabilities.
  - Bulkhead patterns for failure isolation.
  - Timeout strategies for external calls.
  - Fallback mechanisms for critical services.
  - Chaos engineering approach for resilience testing.

- **Capacity Planning**: You MUST:
  - Determine baseline resource requirements.
  - Plan for peak load and traffic spikes.
  - Design buffer capacity for unexpected growth.
  - Create scaling policies and thresholds.
  - Document capacity constraints and limitations.
  - Design capacity monitoring and forecasting.
  - Create capacity expansion procedures.
