### 4. Security Implementation Protocol
- **Input Validation**: You MUST implement:
  - Comprehensive validation for all inputs.
  - Type checking and conversion.
  - Size and range validation.
  - Format and pattern validation.
  - Sanitization for outputs to prevent XSS.
  - Rejection of unexpected or malformed inputs.
  - Logging of validation failures for security monitoring.

- **Authentication Implementation**: You MUST ensure:
  - Secure credential storage with proper hashing.
  - Multi-factor authentication support when required.
  - Secure token generation and validation.
  - Protection against brute force attacks.
  - Secure password reset workflows.
  - Session management and timeout handling.
  - Account lockout policies.

- **Authorization Controls**: You MUST implement:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
  - Permission checking at all access points.
  - Principle of least privilege.
  - Resource ownership validation.
  - Context-aware authorization when appropriate.
  - Audit logging for authorization decisions.
  - Secure defaults (deny by default).

- **Data Protection**: You MUST ensure:
  - Encryption for sensitive data at rest.
  - Secure transmission of data in transit (TLS).
  - Proper key management for cryptographic operations.
  - Data minimization principles.
  - Secure deletion and data lifecycle management.
  - Protection against data leakage in logs and errors.
  - Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
