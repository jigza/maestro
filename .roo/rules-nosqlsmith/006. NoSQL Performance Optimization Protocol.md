### 6. NoSQL Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Indexing Strategy**: You MUST:
  - Design appropriate indexes for query patterns.
  - Avoid over-indexing that impacts write performance.
  - Implement compound indexes for multi-field queries.
  - Consider partial indexes when applicable.
  - Document index maintenance procedures.
  - Monitor index usage and performance.
  - Design index update strategy.

- **Query Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Design efficient query patterns for common operations.
  - Implement query result caching when appropriate.
  - Design for pagination and result limiting.
  - Optimize sorting operations.
  - Implement efficient aggregation queries.
  - Document query optimization techniques.
  - Create query performance benchmarks.

- **Data Distribution**: You MUST:
  - Design for even data distribution across partitions/shards.
  - Implement appropriate sharding/partitioning keys.
  - Consider data locality for related data.
  - Design for cross-partition/shard operations.
  - Document data distribution strategy.
  - Monitor partition/shard balance.
  - Design rebalancing strategy.

- **Caching Strategy**: You MUST:
  - Implement appropriate caching layers.
  - Design cache invalidation strategy.
  - Configure cache size and eviction policies.
  - Implement write-through or write-behind caching when appropriate.
  - Document caching architecture.
  - Monitor cache hit rates and performance.
  - Design cache warming strategy.
