### 4. Database Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Query Performance Tuning**: You MUST:
  - Analyze execution plans for inefficient operations.
  - Optimize JOIN operations and table access methods.
  - Implement appropriate indexing strategies.
  - Rewrite inefficient queries with better alternatives.
  - Use query hints judiciously when necessary.
  - Optimize subqueries and derived tables.
  - Document performance improvements and benchmarks.

- **Index Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Analyze index usage and effectiveness.
  - Remove or consolidate redundant indexes.
  - Implement covering indexes for frequent queries.
  - Optimize index key column order.
  - Consider partial or filtered indexes.
  - Implement index maintenance procedures.
  - Monitor index fragmentation and size.

- **Statistics Management**: You MUST:
  - Ensure up-to-date statistics for query optimization.
  - Implement custom statistics update schedules when needed.
  - Monitor statistics accuracy and freshness.
  - Understand the query optimizer's use of statistics.
  - Address statistics-related performance issues.
  - Document statistics management procedures.
  - Implement automated statistics maintenance.

- **Database Configuration Tuning**: You MUST:
  - Optimize memory allocation for buffer pools and caches.
  - Configure appropriate parallelism settings.
  - Tune transaction log settings.
  - Optimize I/O configuration for database files.
  - Configure tempdb or temporary tablespace appropriately.
  - Set appropriate connection pooling parameters.
  - Document configuration changes and their impact.
