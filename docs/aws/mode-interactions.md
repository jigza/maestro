# AWS Mode Interactions Documentation

## Overview

This document details how AWS modes interact with each other to provide comprehensive solutions. Understanding these interactions helps users leverage the full power of the AWS mode set for complex development tasks.

## Mode Interaction Patterns

### 1. Sequential Processing

Modes often work in sequence, with each mode building upon the work of previous modes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Maestro
    participant AWSArchitect
    participant DynamoDBExpert
    participant AppSyncSpecialist
    participant CloudFormationExpert
    
    User->>Maestro: Build serverless app
    Maestro->>AWSArchitect: Design architecture
    AWSArchitect->>Maestro: Architecture plan
    Maestro->>DynamoDBExpert: Design data model
    DynamoDBExpert->>Maestro: DynamoDB schema
    Maestro->>AppSyncSpecialist: Create API
    AppSyncSpecialist->>Maestro: GraphQL schema
    Maestro->>CloudFormationExpert: Deploy infrastructure
    CloudFormationExpert->>Maestro: CDK stack
    Maestro->>User: Complete solution
```

### 2. Parallel Processing

For complex tasks, multiple modes may work simultaneously on different aspects.

```mermaid

    A[User Request] --> B[Maestro]
    B --> C{Task Distribution}
    C --> D[DynamoDBExpert]
    C --> E[LambdaOptimizer]
    C --> F[AppSyncSpecialist]
    D --> G[Integration]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[CloudFormationExpert]
    H --> I[Final Solution]
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement

Modes may pass work back and forth for optimization and refinement.

```mermaid

    [*] --> AWSArchitect: Initial Design
    AWSArchitect --> DynamoDBExpert: Data Model
    DynamoDBExpert --> AWSArchitect: Feedback
    AWSArchitect --> AWSSecurityGuard: Security Review
    AWSSecurityGuard --> AWSArchitect: Security Updates
    AWSArchitect --> CloudFormationExpert: Final Design
    CloudFormationExpert --> [*]: Deployed Solution
```

## Common Interaction Scenarios

## Mode Communication Protocols

### 1. Context Files

Modes communicate through shared context files:

```
/docs/aws/
├── architecture-decisions.md    # AWSArchitect primary
├── service-inventory.md        # All modes contribute
├── security-baseline.md        # AWSSecurityGuard primary
└── cost-analysis.md           # AWSArchitect maintains
```

### 2. Handoff Messages

Modes use structured handoff messages:

```json
{
  "from": "AWSArchitect",
  "to": "DynamoDBExpert",
  "task": "Design user data model",
  "context": {
    "requirements": ["multi-tenant", "high-volume"],
    "constraints": ["cost-sensitive", "low-latency"],
    "architecture": "serverless"
  },
  "artifacts": [
    "/docs/aws/architecture-decisions.md",
    "/docs/requirements/data-model.md"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Status Updates

Modes update shared status:

```markdown
## Workflow Status

### Phase 1: Architecture Design
- Status: Complete
- Mode: AWSArchitect
- Outputs: Architecture diagram, service selection
- Next: Data model design

### Phase 2: Data Model
- Status: In Progress
- Mode: DynamoDBExpert
- Dependencies: Architecture decisions
- Blockers: None
```

## Interaction Rules

### 1. Mode Boundaries

Each mode respects clear boundaries:

- **AWSArchitect**: Overall design, service selection
- **Service Experts**: Service-specific implementation
- **AWSSecurityGuard**: Security review and compliance
- **CloudFormationExpert**: Infrastructure deployment

### 2. Information Flow

```
Requirements → AWSArchitect → Design
     ↓
Design → Service Experts → Implementation
     ↓
Implementation → AWSSecurityGuard → Security Review
     ↓
Approved Design → CloudFormationExpert → Deployment
```

### 3. Conflict Resolution

When modes have conflicting recommendations:

1. **Maestro** identifies conflicts
2. **AWSArchitect** evaluates trade-offs
3. **Consensus** is reached through:
   - Priority assessment
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Security requirements
   - Performance needs
