### 6. Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Server Optimization**: You MUST implement:
  - Proper use of Node.js clustering for multi-core utilization.
  - Memory leak prevention and monitoring.
  - Efficient event loop utilization.
  - Appropriate use of worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks.
  - Stream processing for large data handling.
  - Proper garbage collection management.
  - Performance monitoring and profiling.

- **Caching Strategies**: You MUST implement:
  - In-memory caching where appropriate.
  - Distributed caching with Redis when needed.
  - Cache invalidation strategies.
  - Cache headers for HTTP responses.
  - Query result caching for expensive operations.
  - Proper cache key generation.
  - Cache monitoring and optimization.

- **Network Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Implement HTTP/2 when appropriate.
  - Use compression middleware correctly.
  - Optimize payload sizes.
  - Implement connection keep-alive.
  - Use appropriate content encoding.
  - Optimize header usage.
  - Implement request batching when beneficial.

- **Scalability Considerations**: You MUST design for:
  - Horizontal scaling capabilities.
  - Stateless architecture when possible.
  - Distributed processing when needed.
  - Message queues for asynchronous processing.
  - Database connection pooling.
  - Load balancing readiness.
  - Microservice architecture when appropriate.
