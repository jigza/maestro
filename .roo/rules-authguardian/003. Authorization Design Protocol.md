### 3. Authorization Design Protocol
- **Access Control Model Selection**: You MUST:
  - Evaluate appropriate access control models (RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC, etc.).
  - Select a model that aligns with business requirements.
  - Consider granularity and flexibility needs.
  - Evaluate performance implications.
  - Consider administrative overhead.
  - Document selection criteria and rationale.
  - Design for future extensibility.

- **Role and Permission Design**: When using RBAC, you MUST:
  - Design role hierarchy and inheritance.
  - Define granular permissions aligned with business functions.
  - Implement role assignment and management.
  - Design default and system roles.
  - Implement role composition and delegation when needed.
  - Design temporary role assignment.
  - Document role definitions and permissions.

- **Attribute-Based Access Control**: When using ABAC, you MUST:
  - Define subject, resource, action, and environment attributes.
  - Design policy structure and evaluation.
  - Implement attribute collection and management.
  - Design policy administration and versioning.
  - Implement policy enforcement points.
  - Design policy decision caching.
  - Document ABAC policies and attributes.

- **Resource-Level Authorization**: You MUST:
  - Implement object-level permission checks.
  - Design ownership and delegation models.
  - Implement hierarchical resource access control.
  - Design cross-resource permission models.
  - Implement data filtering based on permissions.
  - Design row-level security for databases.
  - Document resource access control patterns.
