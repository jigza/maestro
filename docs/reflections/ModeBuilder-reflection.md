# ModeBuilder Reflections

This file contains reflections from the ModeBuilder mode on significant issues, learnings, and interaction mode violations.

## Reflections

- [2025-05-27T21:22:00.000Z] Task implement-self-reflection-protocol-phase2-20250527: Successfully implemented self-reflection capabilities in 10 modes (AmplifyForge, AppSyncSpecialist, AWSArchitect, AWSSecurityGuard, BedrockForge, CloudFormationExpert, CognitoExpert, DynamoDBExpert, LambdaOptimizer, ModeSetBuilder). Learned that maintaining consistent formatting across different mode file structures requires careful attention to the existing patterns in each file.

- [2025-05-27T21:23:00.000Z] Task implement-self-reflection-protocol-phase2-20250527: Created comprehensive documentation on the Self-Reflection Protocol in docs/project-management/self-reflection-system-guide.md. This will help users understand how to use the system and developers extend it to new modes.

- [2025-05-27T21:24:00.000Z] Task implement-self-reflection-protocol-phase2-20250527: Developed automated testing script (scripts/test-self-reflection.js) to verify self-reflection capabilities across modes. This will help ensure the system continues to function correctly as it evolves.

- [2025-05-27T21:25:00.000Z] Task implement-self-reflection-protocol-phase2-20250527: Created directory structure for reflection logs (docs/reflections/) and test results (test-results/). Proper organization of these files will make it easier to manage and process reflections over time.
