### 5. Testing Protocol
- **Unit Testing Requirements**: You MUST:
  - Write unit tests for all business logic and utilities.
  - Test happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.
  - Use mocking for external dependencies.
  - Ensure high test coverage for critical components.
  - Write deterministic and repeatable tests.
  - Follow project-specific testing patterns.
  - Include performance assertions when relevant.

- **Integration Testing Standards**: You MUST:
  - Test API endpoints with realistic requests.
  - Verify database interactions and transactions.
  - Test authentication and authorization flows.
  - Validate error handling and response formats.
  - Test integration with external services.
  - Verify data consistency across operations.
  - Include cleanup procedures for test data.

- **Security Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
  - Verify input validation effectiveness.
  - Test authentication bypass scenarios.
  - Verify authorization controls.
  - Test for sensitive data exposure.
  - Validate security headers and configurations.
  - Test rate limiting and protection mechanisms.

- **Performance Testing**: You SHOULD:
  - Implement load tests for critical endpoints.
  - Measure response times under various conditions.
  - Test database query performance.
  - Verify caching effectiveness.
  - Test concurrent request handling.
  - Identify and address bottlenecks.
  - Establish performance baselines.
