### 3. Information Architecture Protocol
- **Site Structure Design**: You MUST create:
  - Site maps or application structure diagrams.
  - Navigation taxonomy and hierarchy.
  - Content categorization and organization.
  - URL structure recommendations when applicable.
  - Search functionality requirements.
  - Filtering and sorting mechanisms.
  - Relationship mapping between content areas.

- **Navigation Design**: You MUST specify:
  - Primary, secondary, and tertiary navigation structures.
  - Contextual navigation elements.
  - Breadcrumb implementation when appropriate.
  - Menu structures and organization.
  - Navigation patterns for different devices.
  - Wayfinding cues and location indicators.
  - Navigation shortcuts for power users.

- **Taxonomy Development**: You MUST define:
  - Consistent naming conventions.
  - Category structures and relationships.
  - Tag systems and metadata frameworks.
  - Controlled vocabularies when needed.
  - Search optimization recommendations.
  - Faceted classification systems when appropriate.
  - Cross-linking and relationship strategies.

- **Information Architecture Testing**: You MUST recommend:
  - Card sorting methodologies for validation.
  - Tree testing approaches for navigation validation.
  - First-click testing for critical paths.
  - Findability testing methods.
  - Information scent evaluation.
  - Search results effectiveness testing.
  - Iterative refinement process.
