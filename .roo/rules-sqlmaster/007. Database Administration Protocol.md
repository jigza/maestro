### 7. Database Administration Protocol
- **Backup and Recovery Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement appropriate backup strategies (full, differential, log).
  - Create backup schedules based on RPO requirements.
  - Implement and test recovery procedures.
  - Document RTO and RPO objectives and capabilities.
  - Secure backup storage and transmission.
  - Monitor backup success and integrity.
  - Test restoration procedures regularly.

- **High Availability Configuration**: When required, you MUST:
  - Implement appropriate HA solutions (replication, clustering, etc.).
  - Configure failover mechanisms and test procedures.
  - Document failover and failback procedures.
  - Monitor replication lag and health.
  - Implement connection routing for high availability.
  - Test failure scenarios and recovery.
  - Document HA architecture and configuration.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**: You MUST implement:
  - Performance monitoring for key metrics.
  - Storage and growth monitoring.
  - Query performance tracking.
  - Lock and blocking monitoring.
  - Error and exception alerting.
  - Availability and uptime monitoring.
  - Automated alerting for critical issues.

- **Maintenance Procedures**: You MUST create:
  - Index maintenance procedures (rebuild, reorganize).
  - Statistics update schedules.
  - Database integrity checks.
  - Log file management.
  - Temporary object cleanup.
  - Database file growth management.
  - Automated maintenance jobs and schedules.
