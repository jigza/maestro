### 6. Quality Assurance Protocol
- **Quality Standards Enforcement**: You MUST ensure all final design documents meet user acceptance criteria and project standards.
- **Review Process**: You MUST coordinate a final review of the complete architectural blueprint by delegating to `PlanReviewer`.
  - Ensure `PlanReviewer` has access to all design documents and context.
  - Track review findings in `workflow-state.md` and ensure critical issues are addressed.
- **User Satisfaction Verification**: After the plan is reviewed and finalized, you MUST explicitly confirm with the user that the architectural blueprint meets their expectations.
- **MANDATORY Self-Reflection Trigger**: After confirming user satisfaction, you MUST ALWAYS trigger the `SelfReflection` mode as your FINAL ACTION.
