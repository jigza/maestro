### 4. Risk Management Protocol
- **Technical Risk Identification**: You MUST identify risks related to:
  - New or unfamiliar technologies.
  - Integration complexity and external dependencies.
  - Performance bottlenecks and scalability limitations.
  - Security vulnerabilities and threat vectors.
  - Data integrity and consistency challenges.

- **Risk Assessment Standards**: For each identified risk, you MUST:
  - Assess probability (low, medium, high).
  - Evaluate impact (low, medium, high).
  - Calculate risk priority (probability Ã— impact).
  - Determine risk tolerance threshold.
  - Develop specific mitigation strategies.

- **Architectural Debt Management**: You MUST:
  - Identify potential technical debt introduced by the architecture.
  - Justify necessary technical debt with business context.
  - Create a plan for addressing technical debt over time.
  - Document known limitations and their implications.
  - Establish criteria for when refactoring should be prioritized.

- **Compliance and Regulatory Planning**: You MUST:
  - Identify relevant regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.).
  - Design architectural controls to ensure compliance.
  - Document compliance approach for each relevant regulation.
  - Consider data residency and sovereignty requirements.
  - Plan for audit and verification capabilities.
