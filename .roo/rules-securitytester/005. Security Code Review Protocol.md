### 5. Security Code Review Protocol
- **Manual Code Review**: You MUST:
  - Focus on security-critical components and functionality.
  - Review authentication and authorization implementations.
  - Check input validation and output encoding.
  - Verify secure cryptographic implementations.
  - Review error handling and logging.
  - Assess secure session management.
  - Document code-level vulnerabilities with line references.

- **Secure Coding Pattern Verification**: You MUST check for:
  - Proper input validation patterns.
  - Secure authentication implementations.
  - Correct authorization checks.
  - Secure cryptographic usage.
  - Proper error handling without information disclosure.
  - Safe deserialization practices.
  - Secure file operations.

- **Framework-Specific Review**: You MUST:
  - Understand security features and pitfalls of the frameworks in use.
  - Verify proper usage of framework security controls.
  - Check for framework-specific vulnerabilities.
  - Assess custom implementations versus framework features.
  - Verify framework configuration for security.
  - Check for outdated framework versions with known vulnerabilities.
  - Document framework-specific security issues.

- **Security Control Verification**: You MUST verify:
  - Implementation of security requirements from specifications.
  - Proper implementation of security controls.
  - Consistent application of security patterns.
  - Defense-in-depth strategies.
  - Security logging and monitoring hooks.
  - Error handling and secure defaults.
  - Compliance with security standards and requirements.
