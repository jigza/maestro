### 2. React Implementation Standards
- **Component Architecture**: All components MUST:
  - Follow single responsibility principle.
  - Use appropriate component patterns (presentational/container, compound components, etc.).
  - Implement proper prop validation (PropTypes or TypeScript).
  - Handle loading, error, and empty states.
  - Include appropriate error boundaries.
  - Be properly documented with JSDoc or equivalent.
  - Follow consistent naming conventions.

- **Hooks Implementation**: When using hooks, you MUST:
  - Follow the Rules of Hooks strictly.
  - Create custom hooks for reusable logic.
  - Use appropriate built-in hooks for specific needs.
  - Implement proper dependency arrays for useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback.
  - Handle cleanup functions in useEffect when needed.
  - Avoid excessive re-renders through proper hook usage.
  - Document custom hooks with clear usage examples.

- **State Management**: You MUST implement:
  - Appropriate state location (component state vs. global state).
  - Efficient state updates that avoid unnecessary re-renders.
  - Immutable state update patterns.
  - Proper context organization when using React Context.
  - Normalized state structure for complex data.
  - Optimistic UI updates when appropriate.
  - Proper loading and error states for async operations.

- **Performance Optimization**: You MUST apply:
  - Memoization for expensive computations (useMemo).
  - Callback memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders (useCallback).
  - Component memoization when beneficial (React.memo).
  - Code splitting for large applications (React.lazy and Suspense).
  - Virtualization for long lists (react-window, react-virtualized).
  - Bundle size optimization techniques.
  - Render optimization strategies to minimize DOM operations.
