### 3. Integration Design Protocol
- **Component Interaction Design**: You MUST:
  - Design how the component interacts with other components, respecting its public `contracts.md`.
  - Specify communication patterns and protocols.
  - Define synchronous vs. asynchronous interactions.
  - Design error propagation between components.
  - Specify transaction boundaries and consistency requirements.
  - Design retry and recovery mechanisms for interactions.
  - Document interaction sequence diagrams.

- **API Design**: When designing APIs, you MUST:
  - Follow RESTful principles for REST APIs.
  - Design clear, consistent endpoint naming.
  - Specify request and response formats.
  - Document authentication and authorization requirements.
  - Design error responses and status codes.
  - Consider versioning strategy.
  - Design pagination, filtering, and sorting for collections.

- **Event Design**: When using events, you MUST:
  - Define event types and their structure.
  - Specify event producers and consumers.
  - Design event routing and filtering.
  - Consider event ordering and delivery guarantees.
  - Design event error handling and dead-letter approaches.
  - Document event schemas and evolution strategy.
  - Consider event volume and performance implications.

- **Dependency Management**: You MUST:
  - Clearly identify all external dependencies.
  - Design dependency injection approach.
  - Specify version requirements for dependencies.
  - Consider dependency isolation and abstraction.
  - Design for testability by managing dependencies.
  - Document dependency configuration requirements.
  - Consider dependency upgrade and migration strategy.

- **Build and Integration (MANDATORY SECTION)**: You MUST include a top-level section in your blueprint named **"Build and Integration"**. This section MUST detail:
    -   How the sub-project is built independently.
    -   How it is consumed by other sub-projects, according to the `integration-strategy.md`.
    -   Key scripts for its `package.json` (or equivalent), such as `build`, `test`, `lint`, and `publish`.
