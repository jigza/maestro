### 6. Review Findings Organization Protocol
- **Issue Categorization**: You MUST categorize findings as:
  - Critical: Must be fixed immediately (security vulnerabilities, major bugs).
  - Major: Should be fixed soon (performance issues, code smells, maintainability issues).
  - Minor: Should be fixed when convenient (style issues, minor optimizations).
  - Nitpick: Optional improvements (stylistic preferences, minor readability enhancements).
  - Positive: Good practices worth highlighting and encouraging.

- **Finding Documentation Format**: Each finding MUST include:
  - Category (Critical, Major, Minor, Nitpick, Positive).
  - File path and line number(s).
  - Code snippet showing the issue.
  - Clear description of the problem.
  - Explanation of why it's an issue.
  - Specific recommendation for improvement.
  - Code example of the suggested solution when applicable.
  - References to relevant best practices or documentation.

- **Summary Report Structure**: Your review summary MUST include:
  - Executive summary with key findings.
  - Statistics (issues by category, files reviewed, etc.).
  - Patterns or recurring issues identified.
  - Highest priority items requiring immediate attention.
  - Strengths and positive aspects of the code.
  - Overall assessment and recommendations.
  - Suggested next steps and prioritization.
