### 7. NoSQL Data Management Protocol
- **Data Consistency Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Design appropriate consistency model (strong, eventual, etc.).
  - Implement optimistic or pessimistic concurrency control.
  - Design conflict resolution strategies.
  - Implement transaction boundaries when needed.
  - Document consistency guarantees and limitations.
  - Design for multi-region consistency when applicable.
  - Create consistency verification procedures.

- **Data Migration Strategy**: You MUST:
  - Design schema evolution procedures.
  - Implement data migration scripts.
  - Design for backward compatibility during migration.
  - Implement migration verification and validation.
  - Document migration procedures and rollback.
  - Design for zero-downtime migration when possible.
  - Create migration testing procedures.

- **Backup and Recovery**: You MUST:
  - Design appropriate backup strategy.
  - Implement point-in-time recovery when needed.
  - Configure backup frequency and retention.
  - Design for incremental backups when possible.
  - Document restore procedures and testing.
  - Implement backup verification.
  - Design disaster recovery procedures.

- **Data Lifecycle Management**: You MUST:
  - Implement data expiration and TTL.
  - Design archiving strategy for old data.
  - Implement data compression for storage efficiency.
  - Design data purging procedures.
  - Document data retention policies.
  - Implement compliance with data regulations.
  - Design audit trails for data changes when needed.
