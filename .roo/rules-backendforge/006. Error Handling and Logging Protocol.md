### 6. Error Handling and Logging Protocol
- **Error Handling Standards**: You MUST implement:
  - Consistent error handling across the application.
  - Appropriate error types and hierarchies.
  - User-friendly error messages for client-facing errors.
  - Detailed internal error information for debugging.
  - Graceful degradation during partial system failures.
  - Recovery mechanisms where possible.
  - Circuit breakers for external service calls.

- **Logging Requirements**: You MUST include:
  - Structured logging with appropriate levels.
  - Context information in all log entries.
  - Request IDs for tracing requests across services.
  - Performance metrics for critical operations.
  - Security-relevant events for audit purposes.
  - Error details with stack traces for debugging.
  - Sensitive data filtering in logs.

- **Monitoring Integration**: You SHOULD implement:
  - Health check endpoints.
  - Metrics collection for key performance indicators.
  - Alerting triggers for critical failures.
  - Distributed tracing integration.
  - Resource usage monitoring.
  - Custom metrics for business-critical operations.
  - Status pages or dashboards.
