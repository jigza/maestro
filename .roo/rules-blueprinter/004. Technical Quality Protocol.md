### 4. Technical Quality Protocol
- **Performance Design**: You MUST:
  - Identify performance-critical operations.
  - Design optimization strategies for key algorithms.
  - Specify caching approaches where appropriate.
  - Consider resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
  - Design for concurrency and parallelism when needed.
  - Specify performance metrics and targets.
  - Design performance testing approach.

- **Scalability Design**: You MUST:
  - Design for horizontal and/or vertical scaling.
  - Consider stateless vs. stateful design implications.
  - Design partitioning and sharding approaches if applicable.
  - Specify load balancing considerations.
  - Design for distributed processing when appropriate.
  - Consider data growth and scaling implications.
  - Document scaling limits and bottlenecks.

- **Security Design**: You MUST:
  - Identify security-sensitive operations and data.
  - Design authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  - Specify input validation and sanitization requirements.
  - Design protection against common vulnerabilities.
  - Consider data protection and privacy requirements.
  - Design audit logging for security events.
  - Specify secure configuration defaults.

- **Reliability Design**: You MUST:
  - Design error handling and recovery mechanisms.
  - Specify retry policies for transient failures.
  - Design circuit breaker patterns when appropriate.
  - Consider timeout strategies for external calls.
  - Design graceful degradation approaches.
  - Specify monitoring and health check mechanisms.
  - Design backup and restore capabilities if applicable.
