### 3. Responsive Implementation Protocol
- **Breakpoint Implementation**: You MUST:
  - Implement all specified breakpoints from design specifications.
  - Test layouts at each breakpoint.
  - Use relative units (rem, em, %) over fixed units (px) where appropriate.
  - Implement mobile-first or desktop-first approach consistently.
  - Handle edge cases for extremely small or large screens.
  - Use appropriate CSS techniques (flex, grid, media queries) for responsive layouts.

- **Device-Specific Adaptations**: You MUST handle:
  - Touch interactions for mobile devices.
  - Mouse interactions for desktop devices.
  - Different input methods (keyboard, touch, pointer).
  - Device-specific features (notches, safe areas, etc.).
  - Screen orientation changes.
  - High-density displays and appropriate image resolutions.

- **Responsive Testing Protocol**: You MUST test:
  - All specified breakpoints in the design.
  - Text wrapping and overflow handling.
  - Image scaling and responsive behavior.
  - Component adaptations across screen sizes.
  - Navigation patterns on different devices.
  - Form elements and interactive components across devices.
