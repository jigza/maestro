### 4. Column-Family Database Implementation Protocol
- **Column Family Design**: When using column-family databases, you MUST:
  - Design appropriate table and column family structure.
  - Implement efficient row key design.
  - Design column qualifiers for query patterns.
  - Consider wide vs. narrow row trade-offs.
  - Document column family organization.
  - Design for time-series data when applicable.
  - Consider column family compaction strategies.

- **Cassandra Implementation**: When using Cassandra, you MUST:
  - Design partition keys for even data distribution.
  - Implement clustering columns for sort order.
  - Configure appropriate replication factor.
  - Design efficient CQL queries.
  - Implement appropriate consistency levels.
  - Configure compaction and garbage collection.
  - Document Cassandra-specific implementation details.

- **HBase Implementation**: When using HBase, you MUST:
  - Design efficient row key for distribution.
  - Implement appropriate column families.
  - Configure region splitting strategy.
  - Design efficient scan operations.
  - Implement coprocessors when needed.
  - Configure bloom filters and block caching.
  - Document HBase-specific implementation details.

- **Time-Series Implementation**: When implementing time-series data, you MUST:
  - Design efficient time-based partitioning.
  - Implement appropriate TTL and data expiration.
  - Design efficient time-range queries.
  - Consider data aggregation and downsampling.
  - Implement efficient data compaction.
  - Document time-series data patterns.
  - Design for time-zone handling when applicable.
