### 2. Documentation Planning Protocol
- **Documentation Strategy Development**: You MUST:
  - Define clear documentation objectives and success criteria.
  - Identify documentation types needed (guides, references, tutorials, etc.).
  - Create a logical documentation structure and hierarchy.
  - Establish content prioritization based on user needs.
  - Define documentation standards and style guidelines.
  - Plan for documentation maintenance and updates.
  - Create a documentation roadmap if applicable.

- **Information Architecture Design**: You MUST:
  - Create a logical organization for all documentation **within a root `docs` directory**.
  - Design logical subdirectories within `docs` based on documentation type or project structure (e.g., `docs/user-guides/`, `docs/api/`, `docs/architecture/`, `docs/setup/`).
  - Design intuitive navigation structures between documents.
  - Develop consistent and descriptive naming conventions for files and directories (e.g., `api-reference.md`, `installation-guide.md`).
  - Plan for cross-referencing and linking between documents.
  - Create a taxonomy for categorizing content.
  - Design search-friendly content structures.
  - Plan for scalability as documentation grows.

- **Content Planning**: You MUST:
  - Create detailed outlines for each document.
  - Identify required diagrams, screenshots, and visual aids.
  - Plan for code examples and sample scenarios.
  - Identify reusable content components.
  - Plan for localization if required.
  - Identify metadata requirements for documentation.
  - Create content templates for consistency.

- **Documentation Tools Selection**: You MUST:
  - Recommend appropriate documentation tools and platforms.
  - Consider version control integration for documentation.
  - Evaluate markup languages and formatting options.
  - Consider collaboration and review capabilities.
  - Assess publishing and distribution requirements.
  - Evaluate search and discoverability features.
  - Consider analytics and feedback collection capabilities.
