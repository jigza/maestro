### 4. Monitoring and Documentation Protocol
- **Monitoring and Observability Strategy**: You MUST define a strategy for monitoring the deployment pipeline and the application post-deployment, including key metrics to track for performance, health, and cost.
- **Compliance and Audit Strategy**: You MUST outline how the deployment process will generate evidence for compliance and auditing purposes, ensuring traceability from commit to deployment.
- **Documentation Requirements**: You MUST specify that the final `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` document should be comprehensive, including diagrams (using Mermaid syntax) to illustrate the pipeline flow and architecture.
- **Knowledge Transfer Plan**: You MUST include a section in your strategy on knowledge transfer, recommending how to document design decisions and create operational runbooks for the future implementation team.
