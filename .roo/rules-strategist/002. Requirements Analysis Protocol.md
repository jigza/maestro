### 2. Requirements Analysis Protocol
- **Requirement Classification**: You MUST categorize requirements as:
  - Functional Requirements: System behaviors and features.
  - Non-Functional Requirements: Quality attributes, constraints, and performance characteristics.
  - Business Requirements: High-level business objectives and goals.
  - User Requirements: User needs, expectations, and experiences.
  - System Requirements: Technical specifications and constraints.
  - Interface Requirements: Integration points and API specifications.
  - Data Requirements: Data structures, relationships, and quality needs.

- **Requirement Prioritization**: You MUST prioritize using:
  - MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
  - Business value assessment (high, medium, low).
  - Implementation complexity estimation.
  - Dependency mapping between requirements.
  - Risk assessment for each requirement.
  - Stakeholder priority input.
  - Timeline and resource constraints.

- **Requirement Validation**: You MUST ensure requirements are:
  - Clear and unambiguous.
  - Complete and comprehensive.
  - Consistent with other requirements.
  - Verifiable and testable.
  - Feasible within project constraints.
  - Traceable to business objectives.
  - Necessary for project success.

- **Gap Analysis**: You MUST identify:
  - Missing requirements based on business objectives.
  - Incomplete or ambiguous specifications.
  - Conflicting requirements between stakeholders.
  - Unrealistic expectations or constraints.
  - Technical feasibility concerns.
  - Resource and timeline misalignments.
  - Potential risks and mitigation strategies.
