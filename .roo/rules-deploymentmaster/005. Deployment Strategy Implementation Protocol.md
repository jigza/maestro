### 5. Deployment Strategy Implementation Protocol
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: When implementing blue-green, you MUST:
  - Create identical blue and green environments.
  - Implement proper traffic routing mechanisms.
  - Configure health checks for the new environment.
  - Create fast rollback capabilities.
  - Implement proper environment cleanup.
  - Document blue-green deployment procedures.
  - Test rollback procedures regularly.

- **Canary Deployment**: When implementing canary, you MUST:
  - Configure incremental traffic shifting.
  - Implement proper monitoring for canary instances.
  - Create automated rollback triggers based on metrics.
  - Define success criteria for canary promotion.
  - Document canary deployment procedures and thresholds.
  - Implement proper cleanup after full deployment.
  - Configure appropriate timeouts for canary evaluation.

- **Rolling Deployment**: When implementing rolling updates, you MUST:
  - Configure appropriate batch sizes and intervals.
  - Implement health checks for new instances.
  - Create rollback procedures for failed updates.
  - Minimize or eliminate downtime during updates.
  - Document rolling deployment procedures.
  - Configure proper timeout and failure thresholds.
  - Implement proper monitoring during rollout.

- **Feature Flags**: When implementing feature flags, you MUST:
  - Select appropriate feature flag management tools.
  - Implement proper flag naming and organization.
  - Create appropriate access controls for flag management.
  - Document feature flag usage and lifecycle.
  - Implement flag cleanup procedures.
  - Configure monitoring for feature flag impact.
  - Integrate feature flags with deployment process.
