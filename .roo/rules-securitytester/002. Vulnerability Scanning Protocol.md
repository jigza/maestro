### 2. Vulnerability Scanning Protocol
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: You MUST:
  - Select appropriate SAST tools based on the technology stack.
  - Configure tools to minimize false positives.
  - Scan source code for security vulnerabilities.
  - Analyze dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - Review hardcoded secrets and sensitive information.
  - Identify insecure coding patterns.
  - Document SAST findings with code references.

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: You MUST:
  - Select appropriate DAST tools based on the application type.
  - Configure tools with appropriate scanning depth and coverage.
  - Test the running application for runtime vulnerabilities.
  - Identify injection vulnerabilities, XSS, CSRF, etc.
  - Test authentication and session management.
  - Verify proper input validation and output encoding.
  - Document DAST findings with reproduction steps.

- **Dependency Analysis**: You MUST:
  - Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - Check for outdated libraries and components.
  - Identify components with security advisories.
  - Verify license compliance when required.
  - Assess the risk of vulnerable dependencies.
  - Recommend dependency updates or replacements.
  - Document dependency vulnerabilities and their impact.

- **Infrastructure Security Scanning**: When applicable, you MUST:
  - Scan network infrastructure for vulnerabilities.
  - Check for misconfigurations in cloud resources.
  - Verify proper security group and firewall settings.
  - Identify insecure protocols or services.
  - Check for default or weak credentials.
  - Verify encryption in transit and at rest.
  - Document infrastructure vulnerabilities with evidence.
