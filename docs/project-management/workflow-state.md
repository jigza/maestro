## Key Decisions
- Need to commit all current changes to the git repository
- Will delegate to GitMaster for proper git operations
- Successfully committed all changes to the git repository
- Updated .gitignore to exclude appropriate files
- Repository has been forked and needs to be reconfigured with new remote URL
- Need to create a develop branch and merge tm_customizations into it

## Notes
- The repository has both modified files and untracked files
- Some files like node_modules may need to be excluded from git
- All changes have been successfully committed to the git repository
- Git status now shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
