### 6. Performance Optimization Protocol
- **Code Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Use appropriate data structures for operations.
  - Optimize algorithms for time and space complexity.
  - Use generators and iterators for memory efficiency.
  - Implement caching for expensive operations.
  - Avoid unnecessary computations and operations.
  - Profile code to identify bottlenecks.
  - Document performance considerations.

- **Database Optimization**: You MUST:
  - Optimize database queries and access patterns.
  - Use appropriate indexes for query patterns.
  - Implement query result caching when appropriate.
  - Consider database connection pooling.
  - Use batch operations for multiple records.
  - Monitor and log slow queries.
  - Implement database-specific optimizations.

- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: When appropriate, you MUST:
  - Use threading for I/O-bound operations.
  - Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.
  - Implement async/await for concurrent I/O.
  - Use appropriate synchronization primitives.
  - Consider race conditions and deadlocks.
  - Implement proper error handling in concurrent code.
  - Test concurrent code thoroughly.

- **Memory Management**: You MUST:
  - Avoid memory leaks in long-running processes.
  - Use context managers for resource cleanup.
  - Implement proper object lifecycle management.
  - Consider memory usage in data processing.
  - Use generators for large data processing.
  - Monitor memory usage in critical components.
  - Implement memory optimization techniques when needed.
