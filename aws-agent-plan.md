## Notes

- Each mode should leverage appropriate MCP servers
- Focus on Amplify Gen 2 patterns where applicable
- Ensure clear boundaries between modes
- Maintain consistency with existing mode patterns
- Document all design decisions

## Next Steps

1. ~~Begin Phase 1 with AWSArchitect mode creation~~ ✓
2. ~~Test integration with existing modes~~ ✓
3. ~~Update this plan with progress after each session~~ ✓
4. End-to-end testing of complete AWS mode set
5. Final verification and optimization

## Completion Summary

The AWS/Amplify Gen 2 Agent Implementation is now substantially complete:

1. **All 7 AWS modes created**: AWSArchitect, BedrockForge, AWSSecurityGuard, DynamoDBExpert, AppSyncSpecialist, CognitoExpert, LambdaOptimizer
2. **Mode set integration complete**: AWS mode set configured in modeset-config.yaml
3. **Existing modes updated**: CloudFormationExpert and AmplifyForge enhanced with new integrations
4. **Comprehensive documentation created**: User guides, patterns, architectures, troubleshooting guides, workflows, and diagrams
5. **Knowledge base established**: AWS best practices and patterns documented

The only remaining task is end-to-end testing of the complete AWS mode set in real-world scenarios.
