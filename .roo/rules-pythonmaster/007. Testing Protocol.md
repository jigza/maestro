### 7. Testing Protocol
- **Unit Testing**: You MUST:
  - Write tests for all functions and methods.
  - Use appropriate assertions for validations.
  - Mock external dependencies.
  - Test edge cases and error conditions.
  - Organize tests logically.
  - Maintain high test coverage for critical components.
  - Follow test naming conventions.

- **Integration Testing**: You MUST:
  - Test component interactions.
  - Test database interactions.
  - Test external service integrations.
  - Use appropriate fixtures and setup.
  - Implement proper teardown and cleanup.
  - Test error handling across components.
  - Document integration test requirements.

- **Test-Driven Development**: When appropriate, you MUST:
  - Write tests before implementation.
  - Use tests to drive design decisions.
  - Refactor code while maintaining test coverage.
  - Use tests to document requirements and behavior.
  - Implement continuous testing during development.
  - Use tests to verify bug fixes.
  - Maintain a comprehensive test suite.

- **Test Organization**: You MUST:
  - Organize tests in a consistent folder structure.
  - Group tests logically by feature or component.
  - Create reusable test utilities and fixtures.
  - Implement clear test naming conventions.
  - Document test coverage requirements.
  - Implement continuous integration for tests.
  - Set up code coverage reporting.
