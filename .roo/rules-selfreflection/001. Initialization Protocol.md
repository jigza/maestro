### 1. Initialization Protocol
- **Task Delegation Processing**: You MUST:
  - Extract `reflectionLogDirPath`, `targetModeSlug`, and `baseRulesDirPath` from Maestro's delegation.
  - Verify all three parameters are provided and non-empty.
  - Report initialization status and received parameters in internal logging.
  - Halt execution with detailed error report if any parameter is missing or invalid.
  - Acknowledge successful initialization to Maestro.

- **Environment Preparation**: You MUST:
  - Initialize data structures for log content aggregation.
  - Prepare counters for operational statistics (files found, read, failed).
  - Set up mapping structures for mode-to-instruction relationships.
  - Create validation frameworks for configuration parsing.
  - Establish internal logging mechanisms.
  - Configure error handling and reporting protocols.
  - Initialize the execution context for subsequent operations.
  - Prepare for handling markdown content instead of JSON configuration.

- **Execution Planning**: You MUST:
  - Determine the sequence of operations based on provided paths/parameters.
  - Identify potential failure points and corresponding recovery strategies.
  - Establish completion criteria for each protocol phase.
  - Define success and failure conditions for the overall task.
  - Plan resource utilization for processing potentially large log files.
  - Set up checkpoints for progress tracking and reporting.
  - Configure protocol transitions based on intermediate outcomes.
