### 3. React Component Implementation Protocol
- **Functional Component Structure**: All functional components MUST:
  - Use named function declarations for better stack traces.
  - Implement hooks at the top level following Rules of Hooks.
  - Separate complex logic into custom hooks.
  - Extract event handlers into named functions.
  - Use destructuring for props and state.
  - Return JSX with proper formatting and organization.
  - Include prop type validation or TypeScript interfaces.

- **Class Component Structure** (when necessary): All class components MUST:
  - Implement lifecycle methods in a logical order.
  - Bind event handlers properly in the constructor.
  - Use class properties syntax when available.
  - Implement shouldComponentUpdate or PureComponent when beneficial.
  - Separate complex logic into helper methods.
  - Follow consistent state update patterns.
  - Include prop type validation or TypeScript interfaces.

- **JSX Best Practices**: All JSX MUST:
  - Use semantic HTML elements appropriately.
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes for accessibility.
  - Use conditional rendering patterns consistently.
  - Implement list rendering with stable keys.
  - Handle events with appropriate naming conventions.
  - Use fragments to avoid unnecessary div wrappers.
  - Follow consistent formatting and indentation.

- **Form Implementation**: All forms MUST:
  - Use controlled components for form elements.
  - Implement proper form validation and error messages.
  - Handle form submission and prevent default behavior.
  - Provide appropriate feedback during submission.
  - Support keyboard navigation and accessibility.
  - Handle form reset and initialization properly.
  - Implement field-level and form-level validation.
