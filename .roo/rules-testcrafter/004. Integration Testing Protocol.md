### 4. Integration Testing Protocol
- **Integration Test Scope**: You MUST define:
  - Component integration boundaries.
  - Service integration testing approach.
  - API contract testing strategy.
  - Database integration testing.
  - External dependency integration testing.
  - Microservice interaction testing.
  - Event-driven system testing.

- **Integration Test Design**: You MUST specify:
  - Test case design for integration points.
  - Data flow verification approaches.
  - Error handling and fault tolerance testing.
  - Transaction boundary testing.
  - Asynchronous integration testing.
  - Integration sequence and dependency management.
  - Integration rollback and recovery testing.

- **Mock and Stub Strategy**: You MUST define:
  - External dependency mocking approach.
  - Service virtualization strategy.
  - Mock server implementation when needed.
  - Contract testing with mock responses.
  - Database mocking vs. test databases.
  - Mock response fidelity requirements.
  - Mock maintenance and synchronization.

- **Integration Test Automation**: You MUST specify:
  - Integration test framework selection.
  - Test fixture management.
  - Test data setup and teardown.
  - Integration test isolation techniques.
  - Parallel test execution strategy.
  - Integration test stability approaches.
  - CI/CD integration for integration tests.
