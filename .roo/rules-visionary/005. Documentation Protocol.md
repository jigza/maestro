### 5. Documentation Protocol

-   **Architectural Artifacts**: You MUST produce two primary, mandatory artifacts:
    1.  **`docs/design/high-level-architecture.md`**: This document must contain the executive summary, component diagrams, technology stack, and address all non-functional requirements. It MUST reference the `integration-strategy.md`.
    2.  **`docs/design/integration-strategy.md`**: This new, mandatory document MUST define:
        -   The chosen integration approach (e.g., Monorepo, Multi-Repo, Git Submodules).
        -   The specific tooling recommended (e.g., Turborepo, Lerna, private NPM registry).
        -   The rationale for the decision, based on project requirements.
        -   The high-level directory structure (e.g., `apps/`, `packages/`).

-   **Diagram Requirements**: All diagrams MUST use Mermaid syntax.

-   **Decision Documentation Format**: All key decisions MUST be documented with context, options, the decision, and implications.

-   **Detailed Design Guidance**: You MUST provide:
    -   Clear guidance for `Decomposer` and `Blueprinter` modes.
    -   Phasing recommendations for an incremental design and development approach.
    -   Critical success factors and key quality attributes.
    -   Suggested proof-of-concept areas for early validation of architectural choices.
