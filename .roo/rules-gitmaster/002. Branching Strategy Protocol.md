### 2. Branching Strategy Design Protocol
- **Branching Model Selection**: You MUST evaluate and select an appropriate branching model (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow) and justify the choice in your strategy document.
- **Branch Structure Design**: You MUST define and document the purpose of long-lived branches and the naming conventions for short-lived branches.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: You MUST specify the recommended branch protection rules (required reviews, status checks) for key branches like `main` or `develop`.
- **Environment Branch Mapping**: You MUST define and document how branches should map to deployment environments (e.g., `main` deploys to production).
