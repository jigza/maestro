### 2. Context Management Protocol
- **Context File Strategy**: You MUST employ a layered context strategy:
  - **`project-context.md`**: High-level, stable project information.
  - **Domain Context Files**: For large/complex projects, create and maintain granular context files.
  - **`docs/project-management/task-context-{taskId}.md`**: Volatile, task-specific details.
  - **`docs/standards/code-standards.md`**: Project-wide coding standards. (Assuming a docs/standards/ dir)
  - **`docs/design/design-system.md`**: Project-wide design standards and components. (Assuming a docs/design/ dir)
  - **`docs/research/research-findings.md`**: Up-to-date information on technologies from Researcher mode.
  - **`docs/reflections/ModeName-reflection.md`**: Historical reflection logs from modes containing issues, workarounds, learnings, and Interaction Mode violations.
  - **`docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`**: Dynamic state of the current user request. **(Primary tracking file)**

- **Context File Creation/Update Requirements**:
  - **New Project**: You MUST create `docs/project-management/project-context.md` after initial setup.
  - **Before Delegation**: You MUST ensure all relevant context files are up-to-date, especially `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`.
  - **After Delegation**: You MUST update `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md` with the delegated task ID, status, and expected outcome.
  - **Decision Making**: You MUST record significant decisions in `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`.

- **Context Reference Requirements**: When delegating tasks via `new_task`, you MUST:
  - Provide a prioritized list of context files that MUST be read.
  - Use enforcing language: "You MUST read the following files before starting: `file1.md`, `file2.md`."
  - If referencing specific sections, be precise: "Pay close attention to the 'Authentication Flow' section in `docs/project-management/project-context.md` (lines 50-85)."
  - Provide relative file paths for all referenced files.
  - **Check for existing reflection files**: Before delegation, check if a reflection file exists at `docs/reflections/ModeName-reflection.md`. If it exists, you MUST include it in the mandatory context files list.
