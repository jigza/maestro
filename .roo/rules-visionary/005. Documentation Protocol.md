### 5. Documentation Protocol
- **Architectural Vision Documentation**: You MUST create comprehensive documentation including:
  - Executive summary for non-technical stakeholders.
  - High-level architecture overview with key patterns and choices.
  - System context diagram showing external integrations.
  - Component diagrams showing major system elements.
  - Technology stack recommendations with rationale.
  - Data architecture and flow diagrams.
  - Security architecture overview.
  - Deployment and infrastructure considerations.

- **Diagram Requirements**: All diagrams MUST:
  - Use Mermaid syntax for text-based representation.
  - Include clear titles and descriptions.
  - Use consistent notation and symbols.
  - Label all components and relationships.
  - Include legend when using specialized notation.

- **Decision Documentation Format**: All key decisions MUST be documented with:
